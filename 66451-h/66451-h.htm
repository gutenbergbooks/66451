<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">From</span> my early career as a mystical entertainer I have
been interested in Spiritualism as belonging to the category
of mysticism, and as a side line to my own phase
of mystery shows I have associated myself with mediums,
joining the rank and file and held seances as an independent
medium to fathom the truth of it all. At the
time I appreciated the fact that I surprised my clients,
but while aware of the fact that I was <em>deceiving</em> them I
did not see or understand the seriousness of trifling with
such sacred sentimentality and the baneful result which
inevitably followed. To me it was a lark. I was a
mystifier and as such my ambition was being gratified
and my love for a mild sensation satisfied. After delving
deep I realized the seriousness of it all. As I advanced
to riper years of experience I was brought to a realization
of the seriousness of trifling with the hallowed reverence
which the average human being bestows on the departed,
and when I personally became afflicted with similar grief
I was chagrined that I should ever have been guilty of
such frivolity and for the first time realized that it
bordered on crime.</p>

<p>As a consequence my own mental attitude became
considerably more plastic. I too would have parted
gladly with a large share of my earthly possessions for
the solace of one word from my loved departed—just
one word that I was sure had been genuinely bestowed
by them—and so I was brought to a full consciousness
of the sacredness of the thought, and became deeply
interested to discover if there was a possible reality to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
the return, by Spirit, of one who had passed over the
border and ever since have devoted to this effort my heart
and soul and what brain power I possess. In this frame
of mind I began a new line of psychical research in all
seriousness and from that time to the present I have never
entered a seance room except with an open mind devoutly
anxious to learn if intercommunication is within the range
of possibilities and with a willingness to accept any
demonstration which proves a revelation of truth.</p>

<p>It is this question as to the truth or falsity of intercommunication
between the dead and the living, more
than anything else, that has claimed my attention and
to which I have devoted years of research and conscientious
study. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle says in one of his
lectures:</p>

<p>“When one has a knock at the door, one does not
pause, but goes further to see what causes it and investigates,
and sooner or later one discovers that a message
is being delivered,...”</p>

<p>So I have gone to investigate the knocks, but as a
result of my efforts I must confess that I am farther than
ever from belief in the genuineness of Spirit manifestations
and after twenty-five years of ardent research and
endeavor I declare that nothing has been revealed to
convince me that intercommunication has been established
between the Spirits of the departed and those still
in the flesh.</p>

<p>I have made compacts with fourteen different persons
that whichever of us died first would communicate with
the other if it were possible, but I have never received
a word. The first of these compacts was made more than
twenty-five years ago and I am certain that if any one
of the persons could have reached me he would have
done so. One compact was made with my private secretary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
the late John W. Sargent, a man of mature years.
We were very much attached to each other. The day
before he underwent an operation he said to me:</p>

<p>“Houdini, this may be the end. If it is, I am coming
back to you no matter what happens on the other side
provided there is any way I can reach you. And if I
can come, you will know it is I because I am going to
will it so strong that you cannot be mistaken.”</p>

<p>He died the next day. That was more than three years
ago and there has been no sign. I have waited and watched
believing that if any man ever could have sent back word
he would have been the man. And I know that our minds
were so close to each other that I would have received
the signal that my friend wanted to call me. No one
could accuse me of being unwilling to receive such a
sign because it would have been the greatest enlightenment
I could possibly have had in this world.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a sincere and confirmed
believer in Spirit phenomena whose acquaintance I
esteem, advises me that I do not secure convincing results
because I am a skeptic and I therefore want to make it
clear that I am not a scoffer. I firmly believe in a
Supreme Being and that there is a Hereafter. Therefore
since their departure from this earth it has been my
practice, as a final duty, to visit the sacred resting places
of my dearly beloved parents, and ask their protection
and silent blessings through the Omnipotent Almighty.
The very first place I visit when I return from a trip is
this same hallowed spot. Both promised me faithfully
innumerable times in this life that if they could aid and
protect me from their graves or from the Great Beyond,
they would do so. My mind has always been open and
receptive and ready to believe. In attending seances I
have always made a pledge of honor with myself to banish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
all profane thoughts from my mind to the utmost of my
ability. I further pledge myself to concentrate. I have
persuaded my whole soul, brain and thought to a point
where the medium has my attention to such an extent
that at the finish I feel as much exhausted as the medium
who shows to those present the effects of great strain
irrespective of its cause. Thus it must be seen that I
am not a skeptic. However, it has been my life work
to invent and publicly present problems, the secrets of
which not even the members of the magical profession
have been able to discover, and the effects of which have
proved as inexplicable to the scientists as any marvel
of the mediums, and I claim that in so far as the revelation
of trickery is concerned my years of investigation
have been more productive than the same period of
similar work by any scientist; that my record as a
“mystifier of mystifiers” qualifies me to look below the
surface of any mystery problem presented to me and that
with my eyes trained by thirty years’ experience in the
realms of mystery and occultism it is not strange that I
view these so-called phenomena from a different angle
than the ordinary layman or even the expert investigator.</p>

<p>A memorable incident in my life and one that shows
how little the world at large understands the methods
by which my mysteries are produced and also shows how
easy it is for even a great intellect, faced with a mystery
it cannot fathom, to conclude that there is something
supernatural involved, has to do with Madame Sarah
Bernhardt.</p>

<p>During one of my various engagements in Paris she
had witnessed my performances and was anxious to see
one of my outdoor exploits, so, when we were both
playing at the same time in Boston, out of good camaraderie
I gave a special performance at my hotel adding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
a few extra experiments for her benefit. As we were
seated in the motor car on the way to my demonstration
she placed her arm gently around my shoulder, and in
that wonderful speaking voice with which she was gifted
and which has thrilled thousands of auditors, but now
stilled forever, she said to me:</p>

<p>“Houdini, you do such marvellous things. Couldn’t
you—could you bring back my leg for me?”</p>

<p>I looked at her, startled, and failing to see any mischievous
sparkle in her eye replied:</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Madame, certainly not; you cannot be
serious. You know my powers are limited and you are
actually asking me to do the impossible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said as she leaned closer to me, “but you
do the impossible.”</p>

<p>We looked at each other; she, the travel-worn, experienced
woman of the world; I, the humble mystifier,
nonplussed and thunderstruck at the extraordinary, unintentional
compliment she was paying me. Then I asked:</p>

<p>“Are you jesting?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mais non, Houdini, j’ai jamais été plus sèrieux dans
ma vie</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> she answered as she slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>“Madame, you exaggerate my ability,” I told her.</p>

<p>Each of the marvels of modern scientific achievement
such as the telephone, radio, flying machine, radium, etc.,
were at one time classed as impossible and would have
been looked upon as supernatural, if not Spiritual manifestations.
Similar mysteries, but more frail in principle
and constructive detail, were the instruments used by the
priestcraft of ancient religious cults for the purpose of
holding the mass of unintelligent beings in servitude.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for the eye or ear to play tricks with
one but when such illusions and delusions are taken for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
the Spirit forms of the departed and voices of the dead
instead of being recognized as some subjective phenomena
brought about by a physical cause the situation takes on
a grave aspect. It is this transfer of an inner reaction
to an external object which constitutes practically all that
is necessary to be placed in the category of “psychics,”
who represent the priests and ministers of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>Distressed relatives catch at the least word which may
remotely indicate that the Spirit which they seek is in
communication with them. One little sign even, which
appeals to their waiting imagination, shatters all ordinary
caution and they are converted. Then they begin to
accept all kinds of natural events as results of Spirit
intervention. This state of mind is productive of many
misfortunes, including suicides by those who think they
are going to happiness with loved ones beyond the pale.
When in Europe in 1919 finishing an engagement interrupted
by the World War I was impressed by the eagerness
of grief-stricken parents for the solace of a word
from the boy who had passed on and my desire for the
truth was renewed with fresh vigor. I am informed that
so great has the “medium” craze become in Berlin that
the grief-stricken residents have spent great sums of
money in the hope of discovering mediums who will
“guarantee them a glimpse behind the veil.” It is with
the deepest interest and concern that I have watched this
great wave of Spiritualism sweep the world in recent
months and realized that it has taken such a hold on
persons of a neurotic temperament, especially those
suffering from bereavement, that it has become a menace
to health and sanity.</p>

<p>Professor George M. Robertson, eminent psychopathologist,
and Physician-Superintendent of the Royal Edinburgh
Mental Hospital, made the danger of insanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
resulting from strong belief in Spiritualism by neurotics
the subject of a part of his annual report in 1920. He
says:</p>

<p>“Those who had sustained bereavements during the
war and bore them with equanimity in the days of crowded
incidents and amidst the pressure of war activities, such
as Red Cross and other work, find it much harder to bear
up now, although time has elapsed. Some have broken
down since the war came to an end. Many, as a solace
to their feelings, have taken an interest in Spiritualism.
Since Dr. Charles Mercier quoted in the preface of his
book ‘Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge’ my warning on
the danger of neurotic persons engaging in practical
inquiries of a Spiritualistic nature, I have received many
requests to say more on the subject. I have little to add
save to reaffirm the statement then made.</p>

<p>“I do not consider either Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or
Sir Oliver Lodge to be safe judges, whose opinion should
be accepted on this difficult and important subject, in
view of their bereavement and unconscious desires. If
the wish be father to the thought, it is mother to the
hallucination of the senses.</p>

<p>“The tricks the brain can play without calling in
Spiritualistic aids are simply astounding, and only those
who have made a study of morbid as well as normal
psychology, realize the full truth of this.”</p>

<p>I have read with keen curiosity the articles by leading
scientists on the subject of psychic phenomena, particularly
those by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver
Lodge, in which they have discussed their respective
conversions to a belief in communication with the dead.
There is no doubt in my mind that some of these scientists
are sincere in their belief but unfortunately it is through
this very <em>sincerity</em> that thousands become converts. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
fact that they are <em>scientists</em> does not endow them with an
especial gift for detecting the particular sort of fraud
used by mediums, nor does it bar them from being
deceived, especially when they are fortified in their belief
by grief, for the various books and records of the subject
are replete with deceptions practised on noted scientists
who have essayed to investigate prominent mediums. It
is perfectly rational to suppose that I may be deceived
once or twice by a new illusion, but if my mind, which
has been so keenly trained for years to invent mysterious
effects, can be deceived, how much more susceptible
must the ordinary observer be.</p>

<p>During my last trip abroad, in 1919, I attended over
one hundred seances with the sole purpose of honest
investigation; these seances were presided over by well-known
mediums in France and England. In addition to
attending these seances I spent a great deal of time conferring
with persons prominently identified with Spiritualism.
In the course of my intense investigations I have
met most of the famous mediums of our time. I have
submitted to conditions imposed by them and religiously
awaited results, but I still question any so-called proof
of the existence of Spirits who are interested in any
way, physically or mentally, in the welfare of mortal
men. It is not within the province of this book, which
is the result of my years of investigation, to give all
the historical detail concerning every medium mentioned,
though enough are furnished in each instance to establish
my claims, each of which is based on a thorough study
of the records as are also my statements many of which
are supported by documentary evidence in my possession.</p>

<p>I have spent a goodly part of my life in study and
research. During the last thirty years I have read every
single piece of literature on the subject of Spiritualism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
that I could. I have accumulated one of the largest
libraries in the world on psychic phenomena, Spiritualism,
magic, witchcraft, demonology, evil spirits, etc., some
of the material going back as far as 1489, and I doubt
if any one in the world has so complete a library on
modern Spiritualism, but nothing I ever read concerning
the so-called Spiritualistic phenomena has impressed
me as being genuine. It is true that some of the things
I read seemed mystifying but I question if they would
be were they to be reproduced under different circumstances,
under <em>test conditions</em>, and before expert mystifiers
and open minded committees. Mine has not been an
investigation of a few days or weeks or months but
one that has extended over thirty years and in that
thirty years I have not found one incident that savoured
of the genuine. If there had been any real unalloyed
demonstration to work on, one that did not reek of fraud,
one that could not be reproduced by earthly powers, then
there would be something for a foundation, but up to the
present time everything that I have investigated has been
the result of deluded brains or those which were too
actively and intensely willing to believe.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Gladly</span> would I embrace Spiritualism if it could prove
its claims, but I am not willing to be deluded by the
fraudulent impositions of so-called psychics, or accept
as sacred reality any of the evidence that has been placed
before me thus far.</p>

<p>The ancients’ childish belief in demonology and witchcraft;
the superstitions of the civilized and uncivilized,
and those marvellous mysteries of past ages are all
laughed at by the full grown sense of the present generation;
yet we are asked, in all seriousness, by a few
scientists and scholars, to accept as absolute truth such
testimony as is built up by their pet mediums, which, so
far, has been proven to be nothing beyond a more or less
elaborate construction of fiction resting on the slenderest
of foundations, or rather, absolutely no foundation.</p>

<p>Not only educated men and women with emotional
longings for some assurance of the continued existence
of departed loved ones, but people of all phases and
conditions of life, have completely surrendered themselves
to belief in the most monstrous fiction, vouched
for by only a single witness of the so-called phenomenon,
and that too when the medium, through whom the
phenomenon was supposed to have presented itself, had
been caught cheating time and again.</p>

<p>I believe in a Hereafter and no greater blessing could
be bestowed upon me than the opportunity, once again,
to speak to my sainted Mother who awaits me with open
arms to press me to her heart in welcome, just as she
did when I entered this mundane sphere.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FOUNDERS OF
MODERN SPIRITUALISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> story of modern spirit manifestations, so called,
dates from 1848 and the “solitary farmhouse” of John
D. Fox and his wife in the village of Hydesville, in New
York State, and centres around their two little girls, Margaret,
eight, and Kate, younger by a year and a half.
Successfully exploited while still children; credited with
occult power; becoming world-famous as “The Fox Sisters,”—their
record is, without exception, one of the most
interesting in the history of spiritualism.</p>

<p>John Fox and his wife appear to have been of the “good,
honest,” but not mentally keen type of farmer folk. Of
the two, the wife was the more “simple minded,” and
when the “nervous, superstitious woman” began to hear
unusual noises which she could not account for, and which
seemed in some peculiar manner connected with her children,
she concluded at once that the sounds were “unnatural”
and began to brood over the matter. Her fears
increased with the persistent recurrence of the mysterious
sounds, and before long she took some of the neighbors
into her confidence. They were as puzzled as the mother,
the Fox home became an object of suspicion and the neighborhood
set itself the task of solving the mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>With the increase of interest came a proportionate increase
in the noises, which commenced to be known as
“rappings,” and which, in spite of the positive denials by
the children of any knowledge of how they were produced,
regularly answered by an uncanny code questions
asked the two girls. The possibility of duplicity in
such children never occurred to any one in Hydesville,
with the result that the timid hint of a “disembodied spirit”
soon became a theory. Some one asked the girls if a murder
had ever been committed in the house. The ominous
sounds of the code answered in the affirmative and at once
to the eager investigators, the theory became a proven fact
and there flashed up in their minds the vision of a personality
in the Spirit World endeavoring by crude means,
which somewhat resembled telegraphy, to give to human
beings the benefit of its vaster knowledge, the whole affair
in some obscure manner being connected with two little
girls.</p>

<p>At this critical moment a married daughter of John D.
Fox and his wife came home to Hydesville for a visit.
Twenty-three years older than little Margaret, of a very
different type than either father or mother, she seems to
have grasped instantly the possibilities in the “occult”
powers of her little sisters and to have taken complete
command of the Fox family’s affairs at once. Her first
move was to organize a “Society of Spiritualists” and
encourage crowds to come to the house to see the children.
Hydesville became famous almost overnight. News of
the peculiar “rappings” spread with lightning-like rapidity
and soon became an absorbing topic of conversation, not
only in the United States, but in England, France, Italy,
and Germany as well. Women like Harriet Martineau and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning were said to have given their
whole thought to it, and men of the strongest intellect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
and will to be “caught in the meshes it had woven in contemporaneous
thought.”</p>

<p>Hydesville became too small a field for the operations
of Mrs. Fish, the older sister, very quickly, and soon she
appears in Rochester with the girls, publicly exhibiting
their feats to great crowds for money, realizing from one
hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars a night in profits,
which she pocketed. From Rochester she took them to
New York City, and later the girls made a tour of the
cities of the United States, attracting the “most prominent
theologians, physicians, and professional men of all kinds,
as well as great crowds everywhere.” There is no record
that the girls were ever under the management of Mrs.
Fish after they left New York City although she menaced
them continually and Margaret feared her as long as she
lived.</p>

<p>The grand tour over, Kate, sponsored by Horace Greeley,
went to school and Margaret, just developing into an attractive
young woman, and destined to become the more
famous of the two mediums, began a series of seances in
rooms occupied by herself and mother at the Union Hotel
in Philadelphia. There romance entered her life on a day
in 1853 in the person of Dr. Elisha Kent Kane, the noted
Arctic explorer.</p>

<p>His had been a remarkable career. Belonging to one
of the most aristocratic families in Philadelphia; the son
of a judge; handsome; still under thirty-four; graduated
more than ten years previously from the University of
Pennsylvania, he had gone out to China with Commodore
Parker as “surgeon of the embassy,” later obtained a leave
of absence and travelled through Greece on foot, went up
the Nile, toured India, Ceylon, and the South Sea Islands,
and even “dared the Himalayas.” The Mexican War had
furnished him an opportunity to “win spurs for gallantry.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and, this over, he had joined a relief expedition which
went in search of Sir John Franklin in 1850.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>This much travelled, much experienced man of the world
was instantly and irresistibly attracted to the young
medium. An acquaintance was formed and it was not
long before Doctor Kane determined that, regardless of all
obstacles, she should be his wife. In spite of the efforts
of his family, he soon made arrangements to educate
Margaret, and she was placed with a tutor in a quiet suburb
of Philadelphia, where an aunt of the doctor’s could have
an oversight of her and where in addition to her other
studies she was to be made proficient in French, German,
and Italian, as well as vocal and instrumental music. Her
vacations were spent with a sister of Senator Cockrell.
For some three or four years she was thus sheltered from
the world, while the doctor did all in his power to eradicate
from her mind everything connected with spiritualism
and “rappings.” Then came the turn of the tide.</p>

<p>The doctor became broken in health as a result of exposure
in the Arctic and decided to go abroad. There
had been neither civil or religious ceremony to mark his
marriage to Margaret, but just before he sailed, in the
presence of her mother and other witnesses, he declared
that they were husband and wife. His health grew worse
in London and he left there for the West Indies, where
Margaret and her mother were to join him, but their
preparations for the journey were cut short by the announcement
in the papers of his death in Havana on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the 16th of February, 1857. Margaret was prostrated
by the blow. A long sickness followed and when she
finally recovered it was to face the world, not only friendless
and alone, but penniless as well, for, owing to a
compromise, she did not share in the doctor’s estate. Disappointed,
disheartened, and bitter she went back to her
Spiritualism and “rappings.” For thirty years she wandered
from place to place holding seances. For thirty
years she suffered the tortures of remorse and ill health.
She believed she was being driven “into hell.” She
loathed the thing she was, and tried at times to drown her
troubles in wine. For thirty years she lived in constant
fear of her older sister. Then Margaret Kane found a
temporary solace in the Catholic Church. But there were
still more months of struggle before she finally found
courage to tell the story of the world-famous “rappings”
in a signed confession given to the press in October, 1888.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>“I do this,” she said, “because I consider it my duty,
a sacred thing, a holy mission, to expose it (Spiritualism).
I want to see the day when it is entirely done
away with. After I expose it I hope Spiritualism will
be given a death blow. I was the first in the field and
I have a right to expose it.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>“My sister Katie and I were very young children when
this horrible deception began. I was only eight, just a
year and a half older than she. We were very mischievous
children and sought merely to terrify our dear mother,
who was a very good woman and very easily frightened.</p>

<p>“When we went to bed at night we used to tie an apple
to a string and move the string up and down, causing the
apple to bump on the floor, or we would drop the apple
on the floor, making a strange noise every time it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
rebound. Mother listened to this for a time. She would
not understand it and did not suspect us as being capable
of a trick because we were so young.</p>

<p>“At last she could stand it no longer and she called
the neighbors in and told them about it. It was this
that set us to discover a means of making the raps more
effectually. I think, when I reflect about it, that it was
a most wonderful discovery, a very wonderful thing that
children should make such a discovery, and all through
a desire to do mischief only.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>“Our oldest sister was twenty-three years of age when
I was born. She was in Rochester when these tricks
first began but came to Hydesville, the little village in
central New York where we were born and lived.</p>

<p>“All the neighbors around, as I have said, were called
in to witness these manifestations. There were so many
people coming to the house that we were not able to
make use of the apple trick except when we were in bed
and the room was dark. Even then we could hardly
do it, so the only way was to rap on the bedstead.</p>

<p>“And that is the way we began. First, as a mere
trick to frighten mother, and then, when so many people
came to see us children, we were ourselves frightened,
and for self-preservation forced to keep it up. No one
suspected us of any trick because we were such young
children. We were led on by my sister purposely and
by mother unintentionally. We often heard her say:</p>

<p>“‘Is this a disembodied spirit that has taken possession
of my dear children?’</p>

<p>“That encouraged our fun and we went on. All the
neighbors thought there was something and they wanted
to find out what it was. They were convinced that some
one had been murdered in the house. They asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
spirits through us about it and we would rap one for the
spirit answer ‘yes,’ not three as we did afterwards. The
murder they concluded must have been committed in
the house. They went over the whole surrounding country
trying to get the names of people who had formerly
lived in the house. Finally they found a man by the
name of Bell, and they said that this poor innocent man
had committed a murder in the house and that the noises
came from the spirit of the murdered person. Poor Bell
was shunned and looked upon by the whole community
as a murderer.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>“Mrs. Underhill, my eldest sister, took Katie and me to
Rochester. There it was that we discovered a new way
to make the raps. My sister Katie was the first to observe
that by swishing her fingers she could produce certain
noises with her knuckles and joints, and that the same
effect could be made with the toes. Finding that we
could make raps with our feet—first with one foot and
then with both—we practiced until we could do this easily
when the room was dark.</p>

<p>“Like most perplexing things when made clear, it is
astonishing how easily it is done. The rappings are
simply the result of a perfect control of the muscles of
the leg below the knee, which govern the tendons of the
foot and allow action of the toe and ankle bones that is
not commonly known. Such perfect control is only
possible when a child is taken at an early age and carefully
and continually taught to practice the muscles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
which grow stiff in later years. A child at twelve is
almost too old. With control of the muscles of the foot,
the toes may be brought down to the floor without any
movement that is perceptible to the eye. The whole
foot, in fact, can be made to give rappings by the use
only of the muscles below the knee. This, then, is the
simple explanation of the whole method of the knocks
and raps.</p>

<p>“In Rochester Mrs. Underhill gave exhibitions. We
had crowds coming to see us and she made as much as
a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars a night. She
pocketed this. Parties came in from all parts to see us.
Many as soon as they heard a little rap were convinced.
To all questions we answered by raps. We knew when to
rap ‘yes’ or ‘no’ according to certain signs which Mrs.
Underhill gave us during the seance.</p>

<p>“A great many people when they hear the rapping
imagine at once that the spirits are touching them. It is
a very common delusion. Some very wealthy people
came to see me some years ago when I lived in Forty-second
Street and I did some rappings for them. I made
the spirit rap on the chair and one of the ladies cried out:</p>

<p>“‘I feel the spirit tapping me on the shoulder.’</p>

<p>“Of course that was pure imagination.</p>

<p>“Katie and I were led around like lambs. We went
to New York from Rochester and then all over the United
States. We drew immense crowds. I remember particularly
Cincinnati. We stopped at the Burnett House. The
rooms were jammed from morning till night and we were
called upon by those old wretches to show our rappings
when we should have been out at play in the fresh air.</p>

<p>“Nobody has ever suspected anything from the start
in 1848 until the present day as to any trickery in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
methods. There has never been a detection.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> But as the
world grew wise and science began to investigate we began
to adapt our experiments to our audiences. Our seances
were held in a room. There was a centre-table in the
middle and we all stood around it.</p>

<p>“As far as <em>Spirits</em> were concerned neither my sister nor
I thought about it. I know that there is no such thing
as the departed returning to this life. Many people have
said to me that such a thing was possible and seemed to
believe so firmly in it that I tried to see, and I have tried
in every form and know that it cannot be done.</p>

<p>“After I married, Dr. Kane would not let me refer to
my old life—he wanted me to forget it. But when I
was poor, after his death, I was driven to it again, and
I wish to say clearly that I owe all my misfortune to that
woman, my sister. I have asked her time and again:</p>

<p>“‘Now that you are rich why don’t you save your soul?’</p>

<p>“But at my words she would fly into a passion. She
wanted to establish a new religion and she told me that
she received messages from spirits. She knew that
we were tricking people but she tried to make us believe
spirits existed. She told us that before we were born
spirits came into her room and told her that we were
destined for great things.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going to expose Spiritualism from its very
foundation. I have had the idea in my head for many a
year but I have never come to a determination before.
I have thought of it day and night. I loathe the thing I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
have been. I used to say to those who wanted me to give
a seance:</p>

<p>“‘You are driving me into Hell.’</p>

<p>“Then the next day I would drown my remorse in
wine. I was too honest to remain a ‘medium.’ That’s
why I gave up my exhibitions. I have seen so much
miserable deception! Every morning of my life I have
it before me. When I wake up I brood over it. That is
why I am willing to state that Spiritualism is a fraud of
the worst description. I have had a life of sorrow, I
have been poor and ill, but I consider it my duty, a sacred
thing, a holy mission to expose it. I want to see the
day when it is entirely done away with. After my sister
Katie and I expose it I hope Spiritualism will be given
a death blow.</p>

<p>“I do not want it understood that the Catholic Church
has advised me to make these public exposures and confession.
It is my own idea. My own mission. I would
have done it long ago if I could have had the necessary
money and courage to do it. I could not find anyone to
help me—I was too timid to ask.</p>

<p>“I am now very poor. I intend, however, to expose
Spiritualism because I think it is my sacred duty. If I
cannot do it who can? I who have been the beginning
of it? At least I hope to reduce the ranks of the eight
million Spiritualists in the country. I go into it as into
a holy war. I am waiting anxiously and fearlessly for
the moment when I can show the world, by personal
demonstration, that all Spiritualism is a fraud and a
deception. It is a branch of legerdemain, but it has to
be closely studied to gain perfection. None but a child
at an early age, would have ever attained the proficiency
and wrought such widespread evil as I have.</p>

(Signed) “Margaret Fox Kane.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
</p>

<p>Mrs. Kane’s “confession” was published in the Sunday
edition of the New York <cite>World</cite> on October 21, 1888.
Arrangements had been made for her to give a public
demonstration and exposition of the so-called “marvellous”
Spiritualistic “phenomena” that same evening at
the Academy of Music in New York. Meanwhile, in order
to foil the “attempts” of certain mediums to “kidnap her”
she was being closely guarded at her hotel where during
the day she was interviewed by newspaper men. Expecting
when she left her room to answer questions only she
nevertheless readily consented to give some evidence of
“how the trick was done” in order to do all in her power
to “complete the exposure and demonstrate the utter
absurdity of the claim made by mediums that she was
possessed of spiritual power in spite of her denials.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
<cite>World</cite> reporter told of this private demonstration as
follows:</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ said Mrs. Kane, ‘I will stand up before these
folding-doors and you may stand as near as you please
and I will call up any “spirit” that you wish and answer
any questions. One rap means “no” and three raps mean
“yes.” Are you ready?’</p>

<p>“‘Is Napoleon Bonaparte present?’ the reporter asked,
watching Mrs. Kane closely. Three raps (yes).</p>

<p>“‘Does he know me? I mean did he ever meet and
converse with me?’ Three raps.</p>

<p>“‘That is strange, isn’t it,’ remarked Mrs. Kane,
smiling, ‘in view of the fact that he must have died before
you were born? Try again.’</p>

<p>“‘Is Abraham Lincoln present?’ Three raps.</p>

<p>“‘Well you see the “spirits” are very obliging.’</p>

<p>“‘Will Harrison be elected?’ One loud rap (no).</p>

<p>“‘Will President Cleveland get another term?’ Three
raps.”</p>

<p>That night some two thousand or more persons
crowded the Academy of Music to witness the sensational
exposé. Most of them were sober, sensible people who
“hailed with delight” the announcement that one of the
famous Fox Sisters was to make a “clean breast of her
share in Spiritualistic humbuggery.” But certain portions
of the house were packed with pronounced Spiritualists,
men and women who regarded all efforts to disillusion
the public as so many personal insults, and when, previous
to Mrs. Kane’s appearance, Dr. C. M. Richmond,
a prominent New York dentist who had spent twenty
years and thousands of dollars investigating mediumistic
tricks and wiles explained and demonstrated in full light
the full methods of producing them, this Spiritualistic
contingent became decidedly hostile and when Mrs. Kane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
finally stepped before the big audience to “confess orally
what she had already confessed in print” she was laboring
under too great a nervous strain to make any “intelligent
utterance.” Those in charge of the affair realizing that
an address was out of the question at once suggested
that she immediately give a demonstration of the “rappings.”
One of the New York papers the next morning
published the following description of what happened.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>“But if her tongue had lost its power her preternatural
toe joint had not. A plain wooden stool, or table, resting
upon four short legs and having the properties of a
sounding board was placed in front of her. Removing
her shoe, she placed her right foot upon this little table.</p>

<p>“The entire house became breathlessly still and was
rewarded by a number of little short, sharp raps—those
mysterious sounds which have for forty years frightened
and bewildered hundreds of thousands of people in this
country and in Europe.</p>

<p>“A committee consisting of three physicians taken
from the audience then ascended the stage, and having
made an examination of her foot during the progress of
the rappings, unhesitatingly agreed that the sounds were
made by the action of the first joint of her large toe.</p>

<p>“The demonstration was perfect and complete and only
the most hopelessly prejudiced and bigoted fanatics of
Spiritualism could withstand the irresistible force of this
commonplace explanation and exhibition of how spirit
rappings are produced.”</p>

<p>The exposure attracted widespread attention. Letters
poured in from far and wide begging for confirmation,
explanation or denial. The rest of the tribe of mediums
naively hinted that if there had been fraud it was well
to have it exposed but of course <em>they</em> were genuine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Many who had believed in Spiritualism wrote most pathetically.
One of these writing from San Francisco says:</p>

<p>“I have been a believer in the phenomena from its
first inception through you and your sister, believing it
to be true since that time.</p>

<p>“I am now eighty-one years old and have but a short
time of course, to remain in this world, and I feel a great
anxiety to know through you if I have been deceived all
this time in a matter of vital interest to us all.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>But perhaps of them all none better expresses what
a blow the exposure was to thousands who had accepted
as genuine the messages of the mysterious raps or describes
more vividly the effect of Spiritualism on many
who are attracted to it than the following from a woman
in Boston.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>“Hundreds of thousands have believed through you and
you alone. Hundreds of thousands eagerly ask you
whether all the glorious light that they fancied you had
given them, was but the false flicker of a common dip-candle
of fraud.</p>

<p>“If, as you say, you were forced to pursue this imposture
from childhood, I can forgive you, and I am sure
God will; for he turns not back the truly repentant.
I will not upbraid you. I am sure you have suffered as
much as any penalty, human or divine, could cause you
to suffer. The disclosures that you make take from
me all that I have cherished most. There is nothing left
for me now but to hope for the reality of that repose
which death promises us.</p>

<p>“It is perhaps better that the delusion should be at
last swept away by one single word, and that word
‘fraud.’</p>

<p class="clear">“I know that the pursuit of this shadowy belief has
wrought upon my brain and that I am no longer my old
self. Money I have spent in thousands and thousands
of dollars within a few short years to propitiate the
‘mediumistic’ intelligence. It is true that never once
have I received a message or the token of a word that did
not leave a still unsatisfied longing in my heart, a feeling
that it was not really my loved one after all who was
speaking to me, or if it was my loved one that he was
changed, that I hardly knew him and he hardly knew me.
But that must have been the true intuition. It is better
that the delusion is past, after all, for had I kept on in
that way, I am sure I should have gone mad. The constant
seeking, the frequent pretended response, its unsatisfying
meaning, the sense of distance and change between
me and my loved one—oh! it has been horrible, horrible!</p>

<p>“He who is dying of thirst and has the sweet cup ever
snatched from his lips, just as the first drop touches them—he
alone can know what in actual things is the similitude
of this Spiritualistic torture.</p>

<p>“God bless you, for I think that you now speak the
truth. You have my forgiveness at least, and I believe
that thousands of others will forgive you, for the atonement
made in season wipes out much of the stain of the
early sin.”</p>

<p>Margaret Kane’s “confession” did not bring her the
relief or friends she had hoped for, nor did it end her
connection with Spiritualism for, glad as she would have
been to give it up for good, her theatrical exposure was
a financial failure and before long she was down and out
again and once more she resorted to Spiritualism as a
means of livelihood, giving seances and mediumistic
meetings in a number of cities throughout the United
States; but her power of fooling the public was gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Having confessed to deceit once, no amount of persuasion
on her part could convince the public that she was genuine,
and in place of the thousands who had flocked to her
in her younger days she never had more than a handful
at her meetings. Her only friends were Spiritualists for
strangely enough some of them still had faith in her, even
when she was exposing Spiritualism, believing that she
had fallen into the hands of evil spirits when she confessed
that she was a fraud.</p>

<p>Some time after the confession a “recantation” was
circulated as coming from Mrs. Kane. I was never able
to find any proof of its authenticity but my friend,
Mr. W. S. Davis, who knew her well, informed me that
she did make it—that she had to, or starve. It was not
wholly voluntary though as Mr. Newton (then President
of the First Society of Spiritualists) convinced her that
it would be for her interest, and the interest of Spiritualism
as well to do it. It made little difference, however,
for the career of the unfortunate woman was nearly over.
Frequently overcome by drink, forced on by privation
and misery, death came to her, on March 8, 1895, less
than seven years after she had stood in a crowded theatre
and deliberately shown the method of making the raps
which had brought her fame for four decades.</p>

<p>The Fox Sisters used Spiritualism only as a means to
“get while the getting was good.” Fortunately for the
general public Spiritualism received a severe jolt in the
confession of Margaret Fox Kane; there was an end to
the Fox “swindle” and an untold amount of blood-money
and grief saved to poor misguided souls so easily fooled
by a simple physical trick.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Such</span> evidence of spirits as the simple “rappings” of
the Fox Sisters soon gave place to more elaborate “manifestations”
and with the appearance of Ira Erastus Davenport
and his brother William Henry Harrison Davenport,
working together, and known as the “Davenport Brothers,”
these manifestations became complicated exhibitions
involving the use of a cabinet, rope tricks, bells, and
various horns and musical instruments. These brothers
have always been, and are still, pointed to as being indisputable
proof of the reality and genuineness of mediumistic
phenomena and public interest in Spiritualism was
greatly stimulated by the tremendous sensation and discussion
caused by their demonstrations, yet an interesting
train of circumstances put me in possession of facts more
than sufficient to disprove their having, or even claiming,
spiritualistic power.</p>

<p>During many of the years in which I have been making
a study of Spiritualism I supposed both of the Davenports
dead and when my friend, Harry Kellar, in recounting
some of his early experiences and hardships told me that
he had been associated with them at one time and that
Ira Davenport was still living I was surprised indeed. I at
once communicated with him and there followed a pleasant
acquaintance which lasted until his death and furnished
me with much of historic value concerning the
brothers which has never appeared in print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Heretofore all published accounts of the Davenport
Brothers’ doings have been vague, speculative, lacking in
actual knowledge, and misleading because the authors
have been victims of delusion, but the information here
given is based on a long correspondence with Ira Davenport
as well as an open hearted confession which he made
to me shortly before his death, answering all my questions
unreservedly and offering to assist me in every way he
could as he wanted my statements<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> to be accurate in the
book on Spiritualism which he knew I was writing.</p>

<p>The Davenport Brothers were devotedly attached to
each other and when in 1877 William died while they
were in Australia, Ira the surviving brother was completely
upset. He made one feeble attempt to reinstate
himself, but the “Spirit” was lacking and he returned, a
discouraged man, to spend the remainder of his days in
peace and quiet at home. While playing Australia early
in 1910 for Harry Rickards I hunted up the grave of
William Davenport and finding it sadly neglected I had
it put in order, fresh flowers planted on it and the stone
work repaired.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> It was also on this trip that I met
William M. Fay of “Davenport Brothers and Fay,” who
told me many interesting things about the brothers and
on my return to America one of the first things which
I did was to go to Maysville, Chautauqua County, New
York, to make Ira Davenport a visit. He met me at the
station and took me to his home, an exceptionally happy
and restful one presided over by the second Mrs. Davenport,
the first having died in childbirth.</p>

<p>This second marriage was most romantic. During a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
seance which the Brothers were giving in Paris<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Ira
noticed a strikingly beautiful Belgian girl intently watching
him. After the performance he managed to meet
her only to find that she could not speak a word of
English. His French being limited to the usual two or
three word table d’hôte vocabulary of the average American
tourist he called his interpreter and through him
asked the girl to become his wife. Bewildered by such
an audacious proposal she blushed deeply, and cast down
her eyes, then slowly raising them looked straight into
Ira’s. There was a quick exchange of admiration and
her woman’s intuition must have read deeply and correctly
for she then and there consented to wed this
American who had so unconventionally asked her to be
his wife, a decision which she never had occasion to
regret for they were a remarkably happy couple.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>In the tranquil atmosphere of his porch we turned
back the pages of time, Mr. Davenport re-living in retrospect
the trials, battles, praise and applause of long ago.
Among other things we talked over the magical mystery
performers of other days which led him to say very
generously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>“Houdini, you know more about the old timers and
my arguments, than I who lived through those troublesome
times.”</p>

<p>He said that he recognized in me a past master of the
craft and therefore spoke openly and did not hesitate to
tell me the secrets of his feats. We discussed and analyzed
the statements made in his letters to me and he frankly
admitted that the work of the Davenport Brothers was
accomplished by perfectly natural means and belonged to
that class of feats commonly credited to “physical dexterity.”
Not once was there even a hint that Spiritualism
was of any concern to him, instead, discussing his work
as straightforward showmanship.</p>

<p>For me it was a memorable day and did not end with
the setting of the sun, for we talked far into the night,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
I with notebook in hand, he with a long piece of rope
initiating me into the mysteries of the real “Davenport
tie,” which converted thousands to a belief in Spiritualism
and was the genesis<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of the rope-tying stunts which gave
such a stimulus to Spiritualistic discussion in connection
with the brothers. Though many attempts were made to
imitate it, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no one,
not even the magical fraternity, was ever able to detect
the method used in these famous rope tricks, the secret
being guarded so carefully that Ira Davenport’s children
did not know it. I have tested it and for uses such
as they made of it I consider it one of the best rope ties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
in existence to-day, and it is only because I want it on
record when I eventually pass to the Beyond that I am
explaining to the public the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i> which was
as follows.</p>

<p>Built into either side of the cabinet used by the Davenports<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
was a bench through which two holes had been
bored a little distance apart. The Brothers seated themselves
on these benches, and opposite one another, with
their feet squarely on the floor in front of them. The
end of a rope was passed around the legs of one of the
brothers, close up by the knees, and tied. The rope was
then wound around the legs several times, fastened at the
ankles, the remaining portion carried straight across the
cabinet to the other brother’s ankles, fastened, wound
about his legs and tied at the knees. A shorter piece of
rope was then tied to each of their wrists with the knots
lying next to the pulse. These ropes were threaded
through the holes and the wrists drawn down to the
benches, and the ends of the ropes fastened to the ankles.</p>

<p>Their method of releasing themselves was comparatively
simple. While one extended his feet the other
drew his in thus securing slack enough in the wrist ropes
to permit working their hands out of the loops.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The
second brother was released by reversing the action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>After the demonstrations were completed the brothers
slipped their hands back into the loops from which they
had drawn them, placed their feet in the original positions
and were ready to be examined. When the cabinet was
opened the ropes appeared as taut as when put on by the
committee.</p>

<p>In order to disprove the frequently made claim that
the Davenports left their benches to produce certain
manifestations they asked investigating committees to
place sheets of paper under their feet and mark around
them with pencil or crayon thus making it seemingly
impossible to move a foot without detection. But this
in no way interfered or hindered in their performance
for Ira told me they used to slide their feet, paper and
all, and still keep the feet inside the marks, a method I
can vouch for as being practical for I have tried it
successfully.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>With the advantage of working together it was simply
impossible to secure both of the brothers in such a manner
as to prevent their producing the expected results. If
one was in trouble the other was always ready to come
to the rescue for no matter how securely the committee tied
them one was sure to be more loosely tied than the other
and could get a hand free to reach over and help.</p>

<p>“There was one chance in twenty million to hold us
both at the same time,” Ira told me.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The Davenports’ strictest test was known as “The Tie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Around the Neck.” This was also explained to me by
Ira. A committee of three was called upon one of whom
was a woman and for that reason the least suspected
although in reality a confederate.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> She and the Davenports
were each in turn tied around the neck. The woman
released herself by cutting the rope.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Hiding the pieces
in her bloomers she performed her share of the manifestations
and retied herself with a duplicate piece of rope.
No one was the wiser for so curiously allied are our five
senses that the committee, bereft of its sight while such
dark deeds were being done, seemed to have lost the use
of its reasoning power as well.</p>

<p>The first of the Davenports’ public performances were
given in a large hall with rows of seats for the audience
and a small raised platform which served as a stage.
Someone, thinking to prevent the possibility of assistance
by visitors, or confederates in the audience, asked if it
were possible to have the manifestations occur in a closet.
Receiving an affirmative answer one was built with openings
large enough to “insert the spirit hands.” This
closet was a decided advantage to the Brothers as it gave
them an opportunity to work in total darkness which was
an essential element of their performance. The closet
was improved upon by placing a big box in the center of
the stage and there gradually developed the cabinet<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> as
we know it to-day.</p>

<p>During that eventful visit Ira emphatically denied many
of the absurd tales and popular beliefs concerning the
Brothers, among them being the “flour test,” the “snuff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
test”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and such stories as the claim that when a boy at
home he gave a seance for his parents and during levitation<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
was raised up until his head touched the ceiling
breaking both lath and plaster; that he was once levitated
across the Niagara River, a distance of three thousand
yards, and the one telling of his having effected an
escape by Spiritual means from a prison in Oswego, N. Y.,
in 1859.</p>

<p>The Davenports were constantly on their guard against
surprise and exposure and Ira explained to me that when
they were suspicious of a committeeman who wanted to
go into the cabinet with them they would insist that he
be tied too in order to prevent the audience from thinking
he was a confederate. Fastened to a bench as well as to
each of the Davenports he was absolutely helpless for
while one was getting loose the other would strain the
ropes on the committeeman’s feet holding him tight.</p>

<p>He also told me that they were in the habit of reserving
seats in the front row for their friends as a protection
against anyone breaking through. At private circles they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
ran a cord through button holes on all present, ostensibly
to “prevent collusion with the medium,” but in reality as
a protection against a surprise seizure. They once heard
that the Pinkerton Detective agency had been hired to catch
them and in order to effectually forestall any meddler,
they had a confederate smuggle in a bear-trap and after
the seance room was darkened set the trap in the aisle.</p>

<p>I called Ira’s attention to a clipping concerning the
“Dark Seances” from the London <cite>Post</cite>, a conservative
paper, which read:</p>

<p>“The musical instruments, bells, etc., were placed on
the table; the Brothers Davenport were then manacled,
hands and feet, and securely bound to the chairs by ropes.
A chain of communication (though not a circular one)
was formed, and the instant the lights were extinguished
<em>the musical instruments appeared to be carried all about
the room. The current of air, which they occasioned in
their rapid transit was felt upon the faces of all present.</em></p>

<p>“The bells were loudly rung; the trumpets made knocks
upon the floor, <em>and the tambourine appeared running
around the room, jingling with all its might. At the same
time sparks were observed as if passing from South to
West. Several persons exclaimed that they were touched
by the instruments, which on one occasion became so
demonstrative that one gentleman received a knock on
the nasal organ which broke the skin and caused a few
drops of blood to flow.</em>”</p>

<p>After I finished reading it Ira exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Strange how people imagine things in the dark!
Why, the musical instruments never left our hands yet
many spectators would have taken an oath that they
heard them flying over their heads.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Ira Davenport positively disclaimed Spiritualistic
power in his talk with me, saying repeatedly that he and
his brother never claimed to be mediums or pretended
their work to be Spiritualistic. He admitted, however,
that his parents died believing that the boys had super-human
power. In this connection he told me of a family
by the name of Kidder in which the boys faked Spiritualistic
mediumship. The mother, a simple woman easily
misled, became a confirmed believer. After a time the
boys got tired of the game they were playing and confessed
to her that it was all a fake. The shock of the
disillusion almost drove her insane and Ira said it was
the fear of a similar result which kept him from confessing
to his father the true nature of their work. So
when the father asked the boys to do tests for him they
declared that the spirits said “no” and explained that they
could only do what the <em>spirits</em> asked.</p>

<p>But if the Davenport Brothers did not claim spiritual
powers themselves they nevertheless allowed others to
claim them in their behalf. One of the first to do this
was J. B. Ferguson, variously known as “Mr.,” “Rev.,”
and “Dr.,” but I have no way of knowing how his titles
came to him or just what they represented. If I am not
mistaken he had been a minister in the Unitarian Church.
He travelled with the Davenports as their lecturer, a position
filled later by Thomas L. Nichols. Ferguson positively
believed that everything accomplished by the
Davenports was done with the aid of spirits. That both
Ferguson and Nichols believed in Spiritualism is shown
by their writings. Neither of them were disillusioned
regarding the spiritual powers of the Brothers, the secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
of the manifestations being religiously kept from them.
Their remarks were left to their own discretion, the Davenports
thinking it better showmanship to leave the whole
matter for the audience to draw its own conclusion after
seeing the exhibition. Then too with a minister as a
lecturer who sincerely believed the phenomena many
were led to believe, which helped to fill the coffers, meet
the expenses, and increase the publicity which was a
necessary part of the game.</p>

  <div class="caption">IRA ERASTUS DAVENPORT AND HOUDINI, TAKEN ON JULY 5, 1911. THE LAST
PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OLD SHOWMAN</div></div>

<p>In one of the letters which Ira wrote me he says:</p>

<p>“We never in public affirmed our belief in Spiritualism,
that we regarded as no business of the public; nor did
we offer our entertainment as the result of sleight-of-hand,
or on the other hand as Spiritualism. We let our friends
and foes settle that as best they could between themselves,
but unfortunately, we were often the victims of their
disagreements.”</p>

<p>In a letter which Ira wrote from Maysville, dated
January 19, 1909, which I received while in Europe, he
says:</p>

<p>“You must not fail to do me the honor of a visit when
you return to America, although two years is quite a long
time, and in the mean time, please let me hear from you
whenever the ‘<em>Spirit</em>’ moves.</p>

<p>“Regarding the future, I think the possibilities within
your grasp are almost boundless, splendid new territory,
all South of Central America, Mexico, Australia, New
Zealand, India, Spain, Portugal and Africa.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>“My old-time travelling companion, William M. Fay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
told me four years ago while on a visit here from Australia,
that he and Harry Kellar cleared over $40,000 in
about eight months in South America, and Mexico, and
that was thirty-four years ago, and that the opportunities
are now vastly improved, such as <em>railroads, instead of
mules</em>, increase of population, advance in civilization in
those backward countries. He says it would be a pleasure
trip now to what it was when he and Kellar had to travel
on muleback. He was very enthusiastic on the subject
of making another tour and we would have done so but
for the fact that his physicians strongly advised against
it on account of poor health and weakened physical condition.
He is living at present in Melbourne, Australia,
having settled there with his family in 1877, shortly after
the death of my brother, which occurred July 1, 1877.
He is not at all contented, notwithstanding his pleasant
surroundings and ample fortune; after a man has become
a regular ‘<em>Globe Trotter</em>,’ I don’t think it possible for
him to settle down and lead a quiet monotonous life....
I wish here to say that our first tour through Europe
consumed four years, leaving this country, August 26,
1864, returning September 29, 1868. Our second trip
took us over three years, leaving here March 22, 1874,
and returning October 20, 1877, four months after the
death of my brother.”</p>

<p>When exhibiting in Liverpool the Davenports were the
cause of quite a riot<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> which not only militated against
them but stirred up some political strife as well. I will
quote Ira’s account of it from a letter to me dated
January 19, 1909.</p>

<div id="i_028" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">

  <div class="caption">FACSIMILE OF PORTIONS OF A LETTER WRITTEN TO HOUDINI BY IRA E. DAVENPORT</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>“Well, yes, regarding Liverpool, I have very vivid
recollections, and after forty-four years they are far from
being ‘scenes of mystified events,’ they were results
of peculiar combinations, of unfortunate circumstances,
<em>professional jealousy</em>, <em>religious prejudice</em>, <em>anti-American
feeling</em>, with a few other disturbing elements thrown in,
including ‘fenianism,’<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> which was engaging the public
attention at that time, all worked up to a <em>white heat</em>
culminating in one of the most spectacular displays of
‘English Fair Play’ that was ever presented to an appreciative
English public.... While in Liverpool and some
other towns in England, we could not appear in the streets
without being greeted by threatening crowds, with such
exclamations as ‘Yankee Doodle,’ ‘John Brown’s Body,’
‘Barnum’s Humbug,’ ‘Yankee Swindle,’ ‘Fegi Mermaid,’
and many other nice things too numerous to
mention....</p>

<p>“I think my experience in Liverpool stands out as the
most prominent example of ‘Fair Play’ ever dealt out
to any American citizens and a nauseating example
to all foreigners of ‘’ow’ the average Englishman does
things at ‘’ome.’... It was well known that we were
Northern men, and the world knows how the English
sympathized with the slave holders’ rebellion, and they did
not miss any opportunity of showing how they felt at the
time on the subject. While pretending that their brutal
displays of hostility were caused by our refusal to be tied
by a particular kind of knot, in fact our only offence was,
objecting to be tortured at the risk of being permanently
maimed or crippled for life.... Our appeal to the
British public at the time is a plain truthful statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
of the facts, regarding the riots in Liverpool, Huddersfield,
and Leeds which several of the English papers had
the fairness to publish. All England seemed to have
gone mad on the subject of cabinet smashing and speculative
sharpers reaped a rich harvest selling bogus pieces
of smashed Davenport cabinet. Wood enough was sold
in small pieces to make ten times as many cabinets as
the Davenport Brothers ever used during their public
career.... Although I am now in my 70th year, I
would not for one moment hesitate to face the public of
Liverpool, Huddersfield, and Leeds, and try conclusions
with them again, drawing no line or limitations except
those of torturing or maiming one for life.... I shall
always feel a great deal of pleasure in your success, especially
in meeting and overcoming anything in the nature
of hostility and opposition. I remember seeing a notice
of the death of Dr. Slade quite a while ago. I became
acquainted with him in 1860. He then resided in the
State of Michigan.”</p>

<p>The above excerpt shows the pluck and courage of
a genuine showman at the age of seventy, still ready for
a tussle with an entertainment based on natural laws.</p>

<p>The Davenport Brothers while exhibiting in Manchester,
England, had the distinction of being publicly imitated
and ridiculed by two celebrated actors, Sir Henry
Irving and Edward A. Sothern, who were appearing at
the Theatre Royal. With some friends they had witnessed
a performance by the Davenport Brothers and
determined to expose what Irving termed a “shameful
imposture.” With the assistance of these men he gave
a private performance in imitation of the Davenport
seance at a popular club and was so successful that he
was requested to repeat it in a large hall. So on Saturday,
February 25, 1865, the Library Hall of the Manchester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Athenæum was filled with an audience invited to
witness “a display of ‘preternatural philosophy’ in a
private seance à la Davenport provided by some well-known
members of the theatrical profession playing in
the city.</p>

<p>A wig, a beard, a neckerchief, a tightly buttoned frock
coat, and artistic makeup so completely transformed
Irving that he looked the exact double of Dr. Ferguson.
With his inimitable charm of manner Irving assumed the
dignified air and characteristic gestures of the doctor
and impersonating his reverend tones he gave an interesting
and semi-jocose address with just enough seriousness
to keenly satirize the old doctor and at its close
received thunderous applause from the delighted
audience.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>Irving and his friends then proceeded to imitate the
manifestations with a remarkable degree of accuracy.
“The ‘brothers’ were tied hand and foot, placed in a
cabinet, and immediately began their manifestations.
Weird noises were heard, hands became visible through
the opening in the cabinet, musical instruments were seen
floating in the air, and the trumpet was several times
thrown out. When the doors were opened, the brothers
were shown to be securely tied. They reproduced every
effect of the performances accompanied by appropriate
remarks and delightful witticisms from Irving.”</p>

<p>At the close of the seance, the performers received a
vote of thanks, the audience cheering Irving repeatedly.
The Manchester papers were filled for several days with
accounts and letters concerning the Irving seance, and in
response to many urgent requests it was repeated a week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
later in the Free Trade Hall, but the net result of the
exposure to Irving was the loss of his engagement at the
Theatre Royal as he refused to capitalize its success by
giving nightly performances at the theatre.</p>

<p>The extent to which people allowed themselves to be
deluded by the Davenport exhibitions is evident from the
following passage taken from D. C. Donovan’s “Evidences
of Spiritualism.” As a voluntary investigation committee
of one he had been allowed to sit in the cabinet with the
Brothers while the manifestations were in progress. In
his account of his experiences he says:</p>

<p>“Whilst I was inside, several arms were thrust out
at the openings and distinctly seen by persons outside.
Now it is certain that these were not the arms of the
Brothers, because they could not have reached the openings
without rising from their seats, and had they done
this, I should have detected it in an instant; moreover,
if their hands had been free, they could not have played
six instruments at once and still have hands left with
which to touch my face and hands and pull my hair.
Some of my friends endeavor to persuade me that the
Davenports did move, but that being in the dark I did
not notice it. Darkness, however, although highly unfavorable
to seeing, is not at all so to feeling, and I had
my hands on their shoulders, where the slightest muscular
moving would have been detected.”</p>

<p>In view of what Ira Davenport told me about their
manipulations I cannot read the above account without
feeling sorry for Mr. Donovan, who, if his belief was
genuine, had reached the highest point of delusion.</p>

<p>Because of the particular qualifications and aptitude
of magicians to detect fraud it is not surprising that
Spiritualistic publications seize eagerly any word coming
from them favorable to the cause of Spiritualism. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the comment, “it is well worth preserving and placing
beside that of Belachini, the German conjuror, as an
answer to those of our opponents, who, ignorant of legerdemain,
declare our phenomena to be of that character,”
“The Spiritualist” of September 9, 1881, quoted from
the Paris “<cite>Revue Spirits</cite>” the following statement of
E. Jacobs, a French prestidigitator:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Relating to phenomena which occurred in Paris in
1865, through the Brothers Davenport, spite of the assertions,
more or less trustworthy, of the French and English
journalists, and spite of the foolish jealousies of ignorant
conjurors, I feel it my duty to show up the bad faith of
one party, and chicanery of the other.... All that has
been said or done adverse to these American mediums
is absolutely untrustworthy. If we should judge rightly
of a thing we must understand it, and neither the journalists
nor the conjurors possess the most elementary knowledge
of the science that governs these phenomena. As a
Prestidigitator of repute and a sincere Spiritualist, I
affirm that the mediumistic facts demonstrated by the two
Brothers were absolutely true, and belong to the Spiritualistic
order of things in every respect.... Messrs. Henri
Robin and Robert Houdin, when attempting to imitate
these said feats, never presented to the public anything
beyond an infantine and almost grotesque parody of the
said phenomena, and it would be an ignorant and obstinate
person who could regard the question seriously as set
forth by these gentlemen. If, as I have reason to hope,
the psychical studies to which I am applying myself at
this time, succeed, I shall be able to establish clearly (and
that by public demonstration) the immense line of demarcation
which separates mediumistic phenomena from
conjuring proper, and then equivocation will be no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
possible, and persons will yield to evidence, or deny
through predetermination.</p>

<p>Dion Boucicault, an Irish Dramatist and actor of prominence
in America and equally so in Europe, entertained
the Davenports at his home in London (1865) where
he felt assured that the room could not contribute to
fraudulent results. Twenty-three friends, men of rank
and some prominence, among them clergymen and medical
doctors, were in attendance. He did not report if
any were believers, but it is inferred from his writing
that none were. As in other cases, the utmost precaution
was taken to render conditions most acceptable to the
investigators, nevertheless, the usual manifestations took
place and Mr. Boucicault wrote lengthy reports as to
details, and as a conclusion to his report he wrote:</p>

<p>“At the termination of the seance a general conversation
took place on the subject of what we had heard
and witnessed. Lord Bury suggested that the general
opinion seemed to be that we should assure the Brothers
Davenport and Mr. W. Fay, that after a very stringent
trial and strict scrutiny of their proceedings, the gentlemen
present could arrive at no other conclusion than
that there was no trace of trickery in any form, and
certainly there were neither confederates nor machinery
and that all those who had witnessed the results would
freely state in society in which they moved, that, so far
as their investigations enabled them to form an opinion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the phenomena which had taken place in their presence
were not the product of legerdemain. This suggestion
was promptly acceded to by all present.</p>

<p>“Some persons think that the requirement of darkness
seems to infer trickery. Is not a dark chamber essential
in the process of photography? And what would we
reply to him who would say, ‘I believe photography to
be a humbug—do it all in the light, and we will believe
otherwise’? It is true that we know why darkness is
necessary to the production of the sun-pictures; and if
scientific men will subject these phenomena to analysis,
we shall find out why darkness is essential to such manifestations.
It is a subject which scientific men are not
justified in treating with the neglect of contempt.—I am,
etc.,</p>

<p class="sigright p0 b1">“Dion Boucicault.”</p>

<p>Richard Francis Burton, eminent English traveller,
writer, and translator of <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, wrote to
Dr. Ferguson, Davenport Brothers’ lecturer and manager:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have spent a great part of my life in oriental lands,
and have seen there many magicians.... I have read
and listened to every explanation of the Davenport ‘tricks’
hitherto placed before the English public, and, believe
me, if anything would make me take that tremendous
jump ‘from matter to spirit,’ it is the utter and complete
unreason of the reasons by which the ‘manifestations’ are
explained.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nor was it in England alone that able men were completely
fooled by the Davenports’ performance. Frenchmen
as well, after seeing the exhibition, hastened to put
their favorable opinions in writing. Hamilton, a well-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
expert in the art of legerdemain, and son-in-law
of Robert Houdin, the famous conjuror, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Messrs. Davenport,—Yesterday I had the pleasure of
being present at the seance you gave, and I came away
from it convinced that jealousy alone was the cause of
the outcry against you. The phenomena produced surpassed
my expectations, and your experiments were full
of interest for me. I consider it my duty to add that those
phenomena are inexplicable, and the more so by such
persons as have thought themselves able to guess your
supposed secret, and who are, in fact, far indeed from
discovering the truth.</p>

<p class="sigright">“Hamilton.”</p>
</div>

<p>M. Rhys, a manufacturer of conjuring implements and
himself an inventor of tricks, wrote the Davenports:</p>

<p>“... I have returned from one of your seances quite
astonished. As a person who has devoted many years to
the manufacture of instruments for legerdemain performances,
my statement made with due regard to fidelity,
and guided by the knowledge long experience has given
me, will, I trust, be of some value to you.... I was
admitted to examine your cabinet and instruments ...
with the greatest care but failed to find anything that
could justify legitimate suspicions. From that moment
I felt that the insinuations cast about you were false and
malevolent.”</p>

<p>These are but a few of innumerable instances where men
of culture, knowledge and experience, were deluded by
the performance of the Davenport Brothers, just as men
are to-day with my presentations, and when the reader
takes into consideration the confession of Ira Erastus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Davenport<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> to me in 1909, and the fact that he taught
me his full method of manipulating seances, he can then
form some conception of the extent to which the most
intelligent minds can be led astray by what seem to them
phenomena, but to me, mere problems susceptible of
lucid explanation.</p>

<span class="subhead">DANIEL DUNGLAS HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Following</span> the first seances of the “Fox Sisters,”
in 1848, mediums sprang up all over the country like
mushrooms but of this multitude there have not been
more than a dozen whose work, in spite of repeated
exposure, is still pointed to as proof of Spiritualism, and
whose names have found a permanent place in connection
with its development and history. Of these, one of the
most conspicuous and lauded of his type and generation
was Daniel Dunglas Home. He was the forerunner of
the mediums whose forte is fleecing by presuming upon
the credulity of the subject. A new and fertile field was
opened and from that time to the present day there have
been numerous cases of mediums falling into the clutches
of the law as a direct result of using his methods, but
Home had characteristics which went far in many cases
to keep him out of trouble. Outwardly a lovable character
with a magnetic personality and a great fondness
for children; suave, captivating to the last degree, a good
dresser fond of displaying jewelry; an appearance of ill-health
which aroused sympathy and with an assumption
of piety and devotion to established forms of religious
worship, he made his way easily and found favor with
many who would have spurned him under other conditions
and this too, strange as it may seem, in spite of
persistent <em>rumors</em> of immorality in his private life.</p>

<p>Home helped to build up his reputation by not charging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
for his mediumistic services. The claim that he did
not accept fees for his sittings may, or may not, be quite
true, but the fact remains that the spirits were good to
him and provided for his temporal needs abundantly
and sumptuously, and he subsisted on the bounty of his
Spiritualistic friends who seemed to rival one another in
entertaining him in their homes for long periods and
showering him with gifts, a practice which began in
America and was continued in England and on the Continent
to an extent which made a life of positive luxury
possible.</p>

<p>It is strongly intimated that the gifts which Home
received were in many cases <em>suggested</em> by the <em>Spirits</em> he
invoked and his spirit guide seems to have always kept a
sharp eye on his need for earthly sustenance even to the
point of satisfactorily bedecking his person with jewelry.
This was always <em>materialized</em> for him when required, and
since he, personally, could not be held responsible for
what wicked spirits might do, and as they used good
judgment in picking victims, nothing was said about it
and he escaped the prison fate of Ann O’Delia Diss Debar.</p>

<p>His early life was spent in Connecticut but whether at
the home of his aunt in Waterford or with his mother in
Norwich, twelve miles away, is a question, but certain
it is that at the death of his mother he went to the aunt’s.
This was when he was seventeen, two years after the
“Fox Sisters” had begun their career in New York State.
How much he had heard of them is uncertain, something
no doubt, and it is not strange that a youth of his characteristics
might want to emulate them. Then too his
mother had the reputation of being possessed of so-called
“second-sight” and he may have inherited traits which
helped to make the life of a medium look attractive to him.
At any rate, claiming the assistance of his mother’s spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
he tried out his mediumistic powers at the homes of the
neighbors with such success that before long he announced
to his aunt that he was going to set up as a
<em>professional Spiritualist</em>. The lady, a devout Trinitarian,
was so shocked and disturbed, he tells us, that “in her uncontrollable
anger she seized a chair and threw it at me.”
But much as she disliked the idea of the young man becoming
a medium his performances soon attracted so much
attention that she was reconciled to his leaving her home
in Norwich to go to Willimantic, Connecticut, where he
began his life-long custom of living on the bounty of
friends and dupes. His first feats were of the simplest
kind such as are in the repertoire of every itinerant sideshow
proprietor, but his success seems to have been instantaneous.
One reason for this was that while mediums
as a class were a lazy lot Home was an untiring worker
as well as an unflinching egotist and his personal qualities
went far to disarm suspicion and inspire confidence in
the minds of his dupes.</p>

<p>Where he obtained his early education does not appear
but the records are full of indications of considerable
intellectuality. He claimed to have studied medicine and
obtained a degree in New York but he never practiced.
In his later years he set up a studio in Italy<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and gave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
attention to sculpture between seances and “sold busts
at prices quite out of proportion to their artistic merits.”
He studied elocution too and is said to have given many
successful readings.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> He also had the credit of being
quite a musician and playing several instruments, which
partially explains his accordion trick. With it all he was
considerable of a linguist, toward the last being able to
speak most of the modern tongues. He was the author
of two pretentious books<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> whose chief purpose seems to
have been to establish the impression that while all other
mediums cheated at times <em>Home was strictly honest</em> on all
occasions, and in proof it was said that he was never exposed
and never received a fee for his sittings. Nevertheless
one charge of fraud was proven against him in
court.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> It may or may not be true that he was never
completely exposed but many of his manifestations were
discovered to be fraudulent and every one of them
can be duplicated by modern conjurors under the same
conditions. The principal reason why he was never
<em>completely</em> exposed was that he gave no public sittings,
always appearing as the guest of the family where he was
living and as one writer expressed it, “one would no more
think of criticising his host’s guest than he would his
host’s wine.”</p>

<p>On one occasion Robert Browning, the poet, attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
one of Home’s seances. He had become somewhat
alarmed by his wife’s interest in Spiritualism, and when a
face was materialized and said to be that of a son who had
died in infancy, Browning seized the supposed materialized
head and discovered it to be <em>the bare foot of Mr.
Home</em>. Incidentally, Browning had never lost an infant
son. The living son, R. Barrett Browning, in a letter to
the London <cite>Times</cite>, December 5, 1902, referring to this
occurrence said, “Home was detected in a vulgar fraud.”
In the same letter he tells of the modification of his
mother’s belief after having been deceived by a “<em>trusted
friend</em>” and his closing words were: “The pain of the
disillusion was great, but her eyes were opened and she
saw clearly.”</p>

<p>What might be called Home’s American apprenticeship
began in 1850 and in spite of his youth and inexperience
he succeeded in convincing many prominent persons of
the genuineness of his phenomena, among them being
such men as Judge Edmonds,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> William Cullen Bryant,
and Bishop Clarke of Rhode Island. In the spring of
1855 a committee of admirers collected a sum of money
sufficient to send him to England and establish himself
comfortably. He carried with him a letter of introduction
to a man of scientific tastes by the name of Cox who
was proprietor of Cox’s Hotel, in Jermyn Street, and
through whose influence he was able to arrange sittings
with Lord Brougham, Sir David Brewster, Robert Owen,
T. A. Trollope, Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, and others equally
prominent.</p>

<p>After only a few months’ stay in England Home went
to Italy, ostensibly for his health, and for the next four
years he lived on the Continent, travelling from place to
place, living in luxury, being almost continually entertained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
in the homes of “friends,” which in almost every
case were people of rank and wealth. He seems to have
had little difficulty in meeting royalty and nobility on
terms of intimacy even numbering among his patrons the
Emperor and Empress of France as well as the Czar of
Russia. From this clientele he received many and valuable
gifts. At the Russian Court, with its leaning toward
the occult, he was especially welcomed and lived for weeks
at a time in the palace of the Czar, like the similar careers
of Washington Irving Bishop, Mons. Phillipi, and Rasputin.
During his stay in Russia he met a beautiful young
lady of rank and with the approval of the Czar married her.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Home at this time had already begun to show that
fondness for precious stones which finally became so pronounced
that a few years later an English writer in describing
him said:</p>

<p>“But the salient feature of the man after all was his
jewels. On the third finger of the left hand he wore an
immense solitaire, which flashed imperial splendors with
every movement; above that a sapphire of enormous size;
on the other hand was a large yellow diamond and a
superb ruby set in brilliants.”</p>

<p>But these were not all for the writer adds a list of others
in Home’s possession which would easily arouse the envy
of any multi-millionaire’s wife. In view of this fondness
for jewels an incident which occurred just prior to Home’s
leaving the Russian Court is interesting. The story was
told me by Stuart Cumberland. I have heard him repeat
it to others and he also tells it in his book, “That Other
World,” from which I quote.</p>

<p>“Whilst in Petrograd—so at least, a famous diplomat
assured me when I was there—Home did a feat of dematerialization
before the Court which, had it not been for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the favor in which he was held in high places, might have
curtailed his liberty for a period.</p>

<p>“He had dematerialized a splendid row of emeralds lent
the “dear spirits” for the purpose of the test; but up to
the time of his departure from the seance, the emeralds,
for some occult reason, had declined to materialize and
be given back to the confiding owner. They were, of
course, in the spirit land engaging the attention of the
spooks, who seemed to have a pretty taste for valuable
jewels. But the chief of police had not that faith in
spiritual probity generally accepted at the Court, and
before leaving the palace, Home was searched, and—so
the story came to me—the dematerialized emeralds were
found materializing in his coat-tail pocket. They had been
placed there by an evil spirit, of course, but the chief of
police impressed upon the medium that the climate of
the Russian Capital might not be good for his health—that
an early departure would probably benefit it. Home
took the hint and his early departure. To his dying day,
I think he regretted the interference of the evil spirit (or
the police). It would have been so much more satisfactory
for the jewels to have remained dematerialized in
the spirit land, to be materialized at will with no interfering
police around, for they, the jewels, were of great
earthly value.”</p>

  <div class="caption">DANIEL DUNGLAS HOME</div></div>

<p>The year 1859 found Home back in England and
marked the commencement of what proved to be the
period of his greatest success. It was but a few years
later that he attempted his most noted financial venture.
He had become established in Sloane Street, London, as
Secretary of what was called “The Spiritual Athenæum.”
One day, late in 1866, there came to him a widow by the
name of Jane Lyon who was anxious to join his society.
She was seventy-five years old and besides being wealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
in her own right had been left ample means by her husband.
Previous to calling on Home she had read his
book, believed it, and in addition been having a series of
unusual dreams. The medium had little difficulty in
finding a way to make it possible for her to join the
Athenæum, and she told how later at this first meeting
her husband’s spirit “had communicated with her through
Home, and knotted her handkerchief.” Just all that the
spirit of her husband said to her at this interview does not
appear but it was enough to persuade her to give him
twenty-four thousand pounds. The spirits became very
much interested in Mrs. Lyon’s affairs and in November,
at their direction, Home burned her will and before long
she gave him another six thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The attachment between the widow of seventy-five and
the medium of thirty-three grew apace and soon the spirit
of her husband suggested that she adopt Home as her son
“for he would be such a comfort to her.” The suggestion
was immediately acted upon and the medium began to call
himself Daniel Home Lyon. Nor was the spirit forgetful
of the needs of a son, suggesting that an allowance of
seven hundred pounds a year would be about right. In
January (1867) Mrs. Lyon assigned a mortgage of thirty
thousand pounds to Home, only reserving the interest as
an annuity for herself. Not until a month later did she
become worried and consult a lawyer, who assured her
that she had been imposed upon, but she was not convinced
until she had questioned the spirits through a girl
of twelve, the daughter of a flower medium by the name
of Murray. As reported by this girl even the spirits
seemed to think that Mrs. Lyon had been fleeced out of
sixty thousand pounds and she accordingly demanded its
return by Home. He ignored the demand but offered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
return the mortgage if she would give him undisputed
possession of the first thirty thousand pounds and allow
him to drop the name of Lyon. She would not agree to
this. Home was arrested and a suit for recovery begun.
The litigation was long, the case finally ending in May,
1868, with a judgment in favor of Mrs. Lyon; the Court
holding that as the transfer of money and deed had been
accomplished by <em>fraud</em> it was therefore void. In his closing
remarks the Vice Chancellor referred to Mrs. Lyon
as an old lady with a mind “<em>saturated with delusion</em>” and
characterized Spiritualism as being, according to the evidence,
a “system of mischievous nonsense well calculated
to delude the vain, the weak, the foolish, and the superstitious.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Home continued his mediumship, notwithstanding, and
between 1870 and 1872 he held several seances with Sir
William Crookes,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> who was so impressed that he credited
him with being “one of the most lovable of men—whose
perfect genuineness was above suspicion,” an opinion
strikingly in contrast with the verdict in the case of Mrs.
Lyon, but which shows how thoroughly and easily the
followers of Spiritualism are beguiled and misled. <em>No</em>
medium is <em>ever</em> open to suspicion by the faithful and
Sir William Crookes’ statement encourages the belief that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
even scientists are not always immune from the influence
of <em>personal magnetism</em>. He is also quoted as saying:</p>

<p>“As to the theory of fraud, it is obvious that this theory
can account for a very small portion of the facts observed.
I am willing to admit that some so-called mediums of
whom the public have heard much, are arrant impostors,
who have taken advantage of the public demand for Spiritualistic
excitement, to fill their purses with easily earned
guineas; <em>while others who have no pecuniary motive for
imposture are tempted to cheat, it would seem, solely by
a desire for notoriety</em>.”</p>

<p>So it will be seen that even
Professor Crookes, while defending
the so-called genuine
medium, in the same breath
admits that there are fraudulent
practitioners.</p>

<p>DIAGRAM SHOWING ARRANGE&shy;MENT OF
ROOMS, WINDOWS, ETC., WHERE HOME’S
REPUTED FEAT OF FLOATING TOOK PLACE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Home gained wide notoriety
for unusual phenomena
by his reputed levitation
acts, wherein he would
slide from the chair on which
he was sitting to a horizontal
position, then ask to have the
chair removed as it was not supporting him, and would
“float” under a table and back, but his masterpiece, the
incident oftenest referred to, was sailing out of a window
feet first, and sailing into another, seven feet and four
inches distant, landing feet first in an adjacent room, where
he “sat down.” Lord Adare, an observer, expressed surprise
that he could have been carried through an aperture
so narrow as eighteen inches whereupon “Home, still entranced
said, ‘I will show you,’ <em>and then with his back to
the window he leaned over and was shot out of the aperture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
head first, with the body rigid, and then returned
quite quietly</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42, </a> <a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>This is the way the story has been recounted again and
again by Spiritualist writers and speakers and to this day is
told by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with as much seriousness
as if he had been an eyewitness of the occurrence in the full
glare of a noon-day sun.</p>

<p>“When D.D. made that ‘home-run’” around the outside
of his house he seems to have been seeking an altitude
rather than a speed record, as the three reliable (?) witnesses
agree that the windows through which he floated
were in the third story and either sixty or eighty feet from
the ground. This would make the height of each story
from twenty to twenty-seven feet, but <em>tall stories</em> appear
to have been a specialty with these remarkably observant
gentlemen.</p>

<p>In 1920 I made plans for reproducing this window feat
under the same conditions as Home and the late Stuart
Cumberland openly challenged Spiritualists that I was
ready to submit to such a test but no response was received
before I left Europe. Consequently I desire to go
on record as being able to perform the same phenomena
(?) provided I am given the same conditions and scope
which Home was. I believe that those who witnessed the
feat were sincere in giving credence to it but that it was
an illusion and they were deceived by Home, for the mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of the average person accepts what it sees and is not willing
to apply the laws of physics, no matter how much or
how glaringly the act defies the fundamental principles
upon which our very existence depends.</p>

<p>The years between 1859 and 1872 were those of
Home’s greatest success. Toward the end of this period,
however, his popularity waned and having for a second
time married a lady belonging to the Russian nobility, he
gave up the practice of his profession, broke with nearly
all his former friends and returned to the Continent where
he devoted much of his time to writing. He died in 1886
and is buried at St. Germain-en-Laye.</p>

<p>His active career, his various escapades, and the direct
cause of his death<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> all indicate that he lived the life of a
hypocrite of the deepest dye. How strange that these inspired
agents of “Summerland,” these human deliverers
of messages, these stepping stones to the Beyond, are, for
the greater part, moral perverts whose favorite defence is
the claim that they are forced to do such deeds by the
evil spirits which take possession of them.</p>

<span class="subhead">PALLADINO</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Eusapia Palladino,</span> an Italian, has to her credit the
successful deception of more philosophic and scientific
men than any other known medium, being regarded by
some as the most famous of them all, notwithstanding the
fact that she seems to have made no pretence of producing
the class of miracles claimed by D. D. Home and many
others. Materialization was rarely resorted to by her
and there is very little variety in her program from 1892
up to the time of her death in 1918, evidently being content
to astonish investigating scientists with the levitation
and gyrating of inanimate things.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Palladino was born in the Neapolitan district of poor
peasants who died when she was a mere child. Naturally
bright, even shrewd, her perceptive instinct seems to have
developed early in life and continued throughout her
career though she had no education and to the end was
scarcely able to read or write.</p>

<p>Her first contact with the mysterious arts appears to
have been when she was a mere child of thirteen (1867)
in the service of an acrobat or <em>conjuror</em><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> from whom she
must have acquired some degree of skill and knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the uncanny which she may have coupled up with the
marvellous success achieved by Home, and her quick wit
may have opened visions of a change from poverty to that
affluence which she saw was the reward of the professional
phenomena producer, for she began her Spiritualistic work
just following his successful operations in Italy which
served to spread Spiritualism in spite of Papal opposition.
Her part must have been learned well and her plans carefully
laid before she made her debut as a full fledged
medium because she succeeded from the start in baffling
brainy men of science, and while as the wife of a small
shop-keeper she was very poor, she became wealthy within
twenty years after taking up mediumistic work.</p>

<p>She did not attract the attention of the public until
about 1880 when Professor Chiaia, who had been giving
her a lot of attention without detecting her methods, challenged
Professor Lombroso, at that time the most distinguished
scientific man in Italy, to investigate her. Professor
Lombroso did, but failed to detect any fraudulent
work though his decision was delayed for so long a time
that when it was finally given it was claimed that his
mentality had weakened considerably.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>In 1892 Palladino had begun to attract the attention of
scientific men in different Italian cities and had also been
brought to the notice of some of the English Spiritualists
but it was not until 1894 that she went to France. This
trip was brought about through the influence of Professor
Richet, and Sir Oliver Lodge, Professor Sidgwick, and Mr.
Myers took part in the proceedings. On the return of
Lodge and Myers to England they aroused interest in
Palladino by reporting her phenomena to be genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>The first exposure of Palladino was made by Dr.
Richard Hodgson in 1895. A committee from the English
Society for Psychical Research, consisting of Hereward
Carrington, Hon. Everard Feilding, and Wortly W.
Baggally, which had held a series of test seances with
Palladino in Italy, brought her to England for a fresh
try-out and another series of sittings was held. Very early
in the series suspicious movements on the part of the
medium were observed. Later Dr. Hodgson joined the
circle and was able to show conclusively that by clever
manipulation—sheer trickery—she was getting one hand
free and with it making the movements observed.</p>

<p>Her method<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> was to begin by allowing one hand to be
firmly held by the sitter at her side (say on the left) and
let the fingers of her other hand (right) rest on that of
the sitter on her right. In the course of some rapid spasmodic
movements she would bring the sitters’ hands so
close together that one of her own could do duty for two,
being held by one sitter while its fingers rested on the
hand of the other sitter,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> leaving her (Palladino’s) right
hand free to produce the desired “phenomena” after
which it was restored to its original position. Other devices
equally dishonest were observed or inferred.</p>

<p>All of these men were experienced seance observers<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
but the report of their conclusions shows how easily such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
experts were deceived by the very tricks which were later
proved fraudulent by the New York branch of The Society
for Psychical Research. Mr. Feilding’s reports were
the least positive of the three and show that when the best
phenomena were observed the control was not complete
and that the stenographic notes were deficient, and when
read over the day following the sitting they seemed weak
in comparison with a recollection of the manifestations.
That the final reports were based largely on these recollections
is indicated by Mr. Feilding’s statement that:</p>

<p>“We were forced from our proposed colorless attitude
to one of almost proselyting affirmation.”</p>

<p>When Palladino came to America in 1908 she was beginning
to be world famous and her reputation was established;
she was a shrewd woman with a large experience
in the art of misdirection, and with a convenient subterfuge
of unaccommodating Spirit guides whenever her own
resources were exhausted because of some over-zealous
observer. For twenty years or more she had avoided detection
because she had fixed the conditions under which
tests were made and consequently as scientific investigations
they were simply farces. But in New York conditions
were introduced which she did not approve for the
simple reason that she did not know that they existed.
Another difference was that in New York a number of
rehearsals were held and each investigator was assigned
to a special part of the work, thus guarding against the old
trick of drawing the attention away from the place where
a manifestation suddenly developed. The result was
Palladino’s downfall.</p>

<p>On her arrival in New York a group of Columbia professors
became interested in Palladino and arranged for a
series of ten test seances at one hundred and twenty-five
dollars a sitting. Eight of the ten seances had been held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and though a majority of the professors were satisfied that
she was cheating they were unable to prove it. Although
the seances were being conducted secretly by the scientists
one of them, Professor Dickinson S. Miller, discussed Palladino’s
best trick, table levitation, with a friend of mine,
Mr. W. S. Davis, himself an ex-medium whose seances
were always given under test conditions. Davis not only
explained to the Professor the probable method used by
Palladino but demonstrated it as well with the result that
the Professor declared that a full exposure of Palladino
should be made even if it cost ten thousand dollars and
invited Davis to aid at the next seance candidly admitting
that he and his associates were incapable of proper investigation.</p>

<p>Davis replied that scientists were not the kind of men
he could work with but if he would let him bring along a
couple of “Flim-flam” men he would help. Professor
Miller consented to this arrangement provided the men
were palmed off as college professors as otherwise they
would not be admitted. Davis then sent for John W.
Sargent, a past-president of the Society of American Magicians,
and for years my private secretary. He also sent
for another magician, James L. Kellogg. Both agreed
with Davis that his theory of Palladino’s method was
correct. Professor Miller then suggested, that in order to
make the discovery complete and to corroborate any and
all observations, two other persons should be selected to
watch the feet of the medium. Davis accordingly selected
Joseph F. Rinn, another member of the magicians society,
who had assisted in various exposures of pseudo-mediums
and Professor Miller named Warner C. Pyne, a student
at Columbia. It was agreed that these two should be clad
in black even to a head covering and smuggled into the
room under cover of darkness after the seance had convened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and were to sprawl under the chairs and table in
order that their heads might be near enough Palladino’s
feet to detect any movement. I am indebted to my friend
Davis for the following inside story of the sitting just as
he gave it to me.</p>

<p>“After the arrival of Eusapia and Mr. Livingston and
when both had entered the seance room, Rinn and Pyne
came downstairs and hid in the hall where they waited
for their signal. When we were introduced and after the
usual conversation, Eusapia said that she would begin.
Before she had time to pick her controllers, Professor
Miller ushered Kellogg and myself into the positions next
to her. She took a seat at the narrow end of the table and
with her back close to the cabinet curtains. (The cabinet
was formed by placing curtains from the ceiling to the floor,
extending out from one corner of the room). Kellogg
sat at her right and I sat at her left. Eusapia sat close to
the table and her black dress touched the table legs. She
placed her right foot on the instep of Kellogg’s left foot
and her left foot on my right foot, which was her guarantee
that her feet should play no part in the production
of the phenomena. We did not reduce the light at the
beginning of the seance.</p>

<p>“The rest of the party sitting around the table then
placed their hands on its upper surface and formed the
well known chain. Eusapia stamped Kellogg’s foot and
mine and asked us if the control was satisfactory which
of course it was. Eusapia then drew her own hands away
from ours and soon light raps were heard. <em>They were
such as are easily and imperceptibly produced by sliding
the finger tips upon the table top.</em></p>

<p>“We were next favored with responsive raps,—doubling
up her hands she beat the air with her fists in a jerky,
spasmodic way when we heard the light noises on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
wood. The exhibition above board did not occupy our
entire attention. Every one in the party was interested in
the theory of using a foot as a lever to raise the table. As
she beat the air with her clenched fist, she correspondingly
slid her feet away until we felt the pressure on the toe end
of our feet only, whereas there had previously been pressure
on the insteps. Kellogg and I both suspected that
she had succeeded in removing one foot and was making
the other do duty for two. From then on we commenced
to get heavier raps, as though she struck the table leg
with her foot.</p>

<p>“In striking the table leg with the side of her shoe, thus
producing raps, Eusapia also got the exact position in
which her foot should be placed for levitation. When
she rocked the table from side to side it was only necessary
to switch her toe an inch when the left leg of the table
would come down on it, then all she had to do was to
elevate her toe while the heel remained on the floor and
either partial or complete levitation followed.</p>

<p>“We looked pleased and Eusapia began to feel at home.
With a little rest, the rocking was resumed and she considered
it safe to risk the entire levitation. Holding Kellogg’s
left hand up in the air with her right she put my
right hand, palm down, on the top of the table, directly
over the left table leg; then put her left hand over mine,
the tips of the fingers extending rather over my hand and
touching the table. No other hands were upon it. Then,
after a few partial levitations, the table went up into the
air with every leg off the floor. It was our first complete
levitation. As beautiful as any on record and <em>given under
bright lights</em>.”</p>

<p>I asked Davis how he knew the levitation was fraudulent
and he answered:</p>

<p>“(1) During the partial levitations I casually lifted my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
left foot, passed it over the right foot in the direction of
Eusapia and was unable to touch her left leg in the place
where it should have been. (2) Her black dress touched
the table leg and as she took her toe suddenly out from
under it, her dress moved accordingly. (3) By the thud
which the table made when it was deprived of its very
material perch. (4) By the fact that any juggler can
perform the feat when the ‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i>’ is fully understood,
though perhaps not with the same skill. (5) Every
one present knew that the table was steadied at the top by
Eusapia’s hand, which rested upon mine, in turn bore
down over the table leg, held up presumably by Eusapia’s
toe which formed a perfect human clamp.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>(6) What
Rinn and Pyne told us after the seance. They said that
from their position under the chairs they saw Eusapia place
her right foot upon Kellogg’s left and her left foot upon
my right, later they saw her tapping upon our feet with
hers while she made some changes in the position of her
feet. They also saw her slide her left foot away by a few
hitches as her right was twisted around to cover my right
foot which had previously been under her left foot. They
distinctly saw Eusapia strike the table leg with the side
of her foot to produce the raps and they also saw her slide
her toe under the table leg and force the table up by
toe leverage.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>During his narration I asked Davis to tell me if this
astute Italian who had fooled the scientists of the world
was not suspicious or did not sense that she was being
checked up in her movements.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied dryly, “once during the seance she
asked every one to stand up. Two of the ladies in their
inexperience proceeded to obey the command. We had
two spies under our chairs and as we did not want her to
see them something had to be done immediately, so I
pretended to have severe cramps in my legs and while the
interpreter told Eusapia of it Sargent and Kellogg nudged
the ladies to sit down and the medium then resumed her
seat.”</p>

<p>I will not bore the reader with a detailed account of the
cabinet phenomena at this seance under a subdued light
but suffice to say that Davis and Kellogg tricked her as
before and were able to explain every manifestation.
The whole Miller seance was carried out as planned so
carefully that Palladino on the way to her hotel afterwards
told the Columbia student who had acted as interpreter<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
for her that she was well pleased with the evening and
that the seance had been one of the most successful of
the series.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>I quote by permission from a letter written me by Mr.
Davis under date of June 22, 1923:</p>

<p>“Rupert Hughes, in an attack upon Spiritism some time
ago, said that favorable reports on Palladino constituted a
vast literature, and he was right. The public libraries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
both in this country and Europe contain many books in
which it is claimed that it has been ‘<em>scientifically</em> demonstrated’
that Eusapia possesses some occult power.</p>

<p>“Generations for centuries will probably be influenced
by these books. They are only calculated to create superstition
and ignorance and it is a shame that they are permitted
to circulate. Eusapia was one of the world’s
greatest mountebanks. Her dupes were our foremost men
of learning—they were not of the rabble. She was the
greatest mountebank produced by modern Spiritism, and
she duped more scientists than any other medium. In
that respect D. D. Home does not compare with her. The
<em>important lesson in the case</em> is that so-called ‘scientific’
testimony is just about worthless. That is an important
educational fact and a valuable lesson to the general
public.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davis is quite right in his view of the seriousness
of the possible danger and damage to the reading public
from the effects of the grossly misapplied energy of the
prominent scientists who have so unqualifiedly endorsed
Eusapia Palladino as a genuine miracle worker, and the
hosts of Spiritualistic enthusiasts who have repeated their
published statements. Even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle unqualifiedly
lauds Home and Palladino as patron saints of his
psychic religion (?). He accepts as proof the fact that
these learned scientists met their Waterloo in an attempt
to fathom the simple tricks of impostors, and like all other
Spiritualists refuses to accept the positive proof of the
deception secured by men schooled in the science of magic
which at times is as seemingly unexplainable as the more
profound subjects of natural science.</p>

<p>The reader should bear in mind that Mr. Davis’ <em>sincerity</em>
is just as great as is Sir Arthur’s. <em>Sincerity</em> is Sir
Arthur’s strong magnet and the reader should attach as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
much importance to <em>sincerity</em> on the part of an opponent.
We must also take into consideration the fact that Mr.
Davis was at one time a <em>medium</em> himself and he has had
much opportunity for observing the qualifications of scientists
as occult investigators. We must notice too the
methods of conducting the seances in which such diverse
results were obtained. Those held with only scientists as
observers were under the full control of the medium and
all her conditions were conformed to, but in New York
it was practically a case of fighting fire with fire. It is
proverbial that “it takes a rogue to catch a rogue”—just
so a trickster is more capable of setting traps to detect
trickery than the grave scientist in his endeavor to solve
the problem by mathematics or logic. In the successful
instance the plan of operation had been carefully worked
out in every detail, each participant was assigned a specific
work to do and did it. A number of rehearsals were
held so that each person was familiar with their part. All
the conditions so strenuously adhered to in previous seances,
were safeguarded and the result was a successful
exposure.</p>

  <div class="caption">EUSAPIA PALLADINO AND HER SEANCE TABLE</div></div>

<p>When Carrington brought Palladino to this country
he announced that he did so in the interest of “science.”
Publicity was not to be ignored though and consequently
the first seance was given before newspaper men. William
A. Brady (the theatrical man) occupied the seat of
honor which made it look as though Carrington hoped for
some theatrical business as a side issue to the seances
with scientists at a hundred and twenty-five dollars a sitting.
It is also known that Carrington made a contract
with a popular magazine which gave it an exclusive right
to publish reports of the seances and naturally Carrington
was to have received a liberal fee. But Mr. Davis in 1909
furnished the <i>New York Times</i> with two articles making a
sensational attack on Palladino whereupon the magazine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
people cancelled their contract with Carrington on the
ground that Davis had put a “frost” on their plans. As
a result Carrington threatened the <i>Times</i> with a suit for a
hundred thousand dollars damage. The threat was
dropped after Palladino’s complete exposure and her refusal
to go to the Times Building and win the two thousand
dollar prize offered by Rinn. In all the seances conducted
by Carrington the program was the same and the
phenomena of precisely the same character as in the one
which resulted in Palladino’s complete exposure. The
value of Mr. Carrington’s opinion as evidence may be
judged from excerpts from an article in <cite>McClure’s Magazine</cite>
for October, 1909. In this article he answers his
own question “Does Eusapia Deceive Her Investigators?”
by saying:</p>

<p>“Well do I know the condition of mind induced by one
or two seances with Eusapia. All one’s previous experience
is refuted, and the mind fails to grasp the facts or to
accept them as real. It is incapable of absorbing them.
It requires several seances before one is convinced of the
reality of the phenomena, and of the fact that one’s observation
is not mistaken. Personally, I had to witness six
seances before I was irrevocably and finally convinced of
the reality of the fact. Before that, although I was quite
unable to explain what I saw by any theory of fraud or
trickery, and although I was quite certain the facts were
not due to hallucination, still I could not believe them. I
felt that there must be a loophole somewhere; and I know
that my colleagues felt exactly as I did. But at the sixth
seance when I was controlling the medium myself, in such
a manner that I was quite sure as to the whereabouts of
her whole body, and when it was, moreover, light enough
to see the whole outline of her body clearly,—when, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
spite of this, phenomena continued to take place all
around us in the most bewildering manner and under the
most perfect test conditions, I felt that there was no more
to be said; certainty had been achieved; and from the
sixth seance onward, and forever after, I shall remain as
certain that these phenomena are facts, and form a part—however
sporadic—of nature, as I am that I write this
article.”</p>

<p>The foregoing shows how vacillating the mind of Mr.
Carrington was at the time he was conducting the Palladino
seances, and when after a personal contest with the
medium he stated his conviction he should have known
he was talking the impossible; that no one man could
control Palladino beyond the possibility of fraud and at
the same time detect her false moves. In the same article
he writes:</p>

<p>“I may remark just here that this medium has been
caught in trickery from time to time, and will almost
invariably resort to it unless she is prevented from doing
so by the rigidity of the control (that is, the degree of
certainty obtained in holding her hands and feet). The
reason for this is that Eusapia, knowing that the production
of genuine phenomena will exhaust her nervous
forces, resorts to this simpler method, if her sitters are
sufficiently credulous to allow it, in order to save herself
from the painful after effects of a genuine seance. Nearly
every investigator has at one time or another discovered
this fraud, which is petty, and more or less obvious to
any careful investigator, and consists in the substitution
of one hand for two, and in the production of phenomena
with the remaining free hand. If, however, sufficient
precautions are taken, it is a comparatively easy matter
to frustrate her attempts at fraud; and when this is done
so-called genuine phenomena are produced. Many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
the phenomena are so incredible that by far the simplest
explanation is that fraud has been operative in their
production; but I can say positively (and I believe the
records will show this) that fraud was quite impossible
throughout our seances, not only because of the nature
of our control of the medium, which was rigidly exacting,
but because of the abundance of light. Any theory based
upon the supposition that confederates were employed is
absolutely discounted: first, because the seances were held
in our own locked rooms in the hotel; and secondly, because
throughout the seances it was light enough for us
to see the whole room and its occupants. It is hardly
necessary to add that we examined the cabinet, the table,
instruments, and all articles of furniture, both before and
after each seance.”</p>

<p>This last seems just as a manager might be expected
to talk of the merit of his own show. A salesman should
not decry his wares.</p>

<p>There is no question but what Palladino was given to
fraud.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> In personal conversations with Hon. Everard
Feilding, W. W. Baggally, E. J. Dingwall and Hereward
Carrington, each stated positively that they had caught
her cheating and that they knew her to be a fraud. They
claimed that toward the end of her career she lost her
occult power and at such times as the Spirits failed her she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
would resort to trickery rather than confess failure. They
believed her a genuine medium because of the things
which she did under test conditions which they could not
explain, their knowledge of fraud being overpowered, apparently,
by a willingness to believe in the impossible
simply because they were not able to solve the problem.</p>

<p>If you go to a department store and ask for a well
advertised bit of merchandise and when you get home you
find the clerk has substituted “something just as good”
you either report the clerk to the management or else
you do not patronize the store again; if you go to a tailor
and he sells you an “all-wool” suit and you find that most
of the “wool” grew on cotton plants you pass that store
by when you are ready to buy another suit; if you catch
your best friend cheating at cards you refuse to play with
him again ever and a life-time friendship is broken up.
But Palladino cheated at Cambridge, she cheated in
l’Aguélas, and she cheated in New York and yet each
time that she was caught cheating the Spiritualists upheld
her, excused her, and forgave her. Truly their logic
sometimes borders on the humorous.</p>

<p>F. W. H. Myers wrote in “Borderland” in 1896:</p>

<p>“These frauds were practiced in and out of the real, or
alleged, trance and were so skillfully executed that the
poor woman must have practiced them long and carefully.”</p>

<p>Palladino is summed up in these few lines.</p>

<p>My opinion is that Palladino in her crafty prime may
have possessed the agility and abundant skill in misdirection
together with sufficient energy and nerve to
bamboozle<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> her scientific and otherwise astute committeemen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
but as time demanded its toll she probably lost her
vim and nerve and became unable to present her “performances”
with the success that attended her earlier
demonstrations.</p>

<p>My old friend, John William Sargent, who died on
September 24, 1920, was one of the committee which
finally dethroned Palladino, and I believe it no more than
just that the last word of this chapter should be said by
him.</p>

<p>“Eusapia Palladino is dead and I have little doubt that
she departed hence without forgiving me for the part I
took in spoiling her business in America by assisting in
the exposure of her little bag of tricks. It is an open
question, however, whether the exposure of her trickery,
or in fact of any of the class of sensation mongers to
which she belonged, ever turned a soul from belief in
Spiritism; some of the leading newspapers, in commenting
on her death, show that in spite of the complete exposure
of her methods, there still remains in the minds of many
intelligent people the conviction that she was far from
an impostor. I cannot understand how any reasonable
person could see in this woman anything more than a
fairly clever charlatan, whose success was due more to
the credulity of her audiences than the skill of her performances.
What did all her exposures amount to?
Those who believed have continued to believe, and
in spite of the old saw, ‘Truth is mighty and must prevail,’
the name of Eusapia Palladino will be on the lips of
men long, long after her exposers are forgotten dust.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ANN O’DELIA DISS DEBAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> coming and going of Ann O’Delia Diss Debar are
mysteries for there is no record of her birth and no trace
of her death, but the “in between time” furnished
material enough for an entire book rather than a single
chapter, and gave her sufficient opportunity to have it said
of her that she was “one of the most extraordinary fake
mediums and mystery swindlers the world has ever
known.” Some even have classed her among the ten
most prominent and dangerous female criminals of the
world, and her repertoire is claimed to have run the full
gamut from petty confidence games to elaborately contrived
schemes aimed at the magnates of Wall Street.
According to report she did not hesitate to victimize the
innocent and the mentally unsound and left behind her a
trail of sorrow, depleted pocket-books, and impaired
morals that has seldom been equaled. Like many master
criminals she escaped punishment for a time but in the
end fell into the toils of the law and served time both here
and in England. The marvellous tact with which she devoted
her great powers to the purposes of self aggrandizement
and profit is without parallel, and for cunning
knavery, Cagliostro, by comparison, seems to have been
an amateur. It is alleged that her crimes ranged from
the smallest to the largest with morals as low as one can
imagine in a human being while, worst of all, she flaunted
this viciousness openly, making no effort whatever to cloak
her degeneracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless her name stands among the half score or
more in the front ranks of the history of Spiritualism and
with Daniel Dunglas Home shares the palm for the successful
manipulation of big schemes. It was not unusual
for her to make deals that ran into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars and though the two were early in the
mediumistic field, I believe that to this day they have
had no peer in this respect. Possibly all other mediums
combined could not have aggregated the amount of money
obtained by these two.</p>

<p>Whether Home outbids Diss Debar for preëminence as
to gain it is hard to say but it is certain that he “could
not hold a candle” to her versatility. Both appear to have
had the advantage of being scholastic, and well versed in
historic lore and the classics, which gave them great prestige
with cultured people, opening the doors to the social
life of the “upper-ten,” and bringing within their reach
people of wealth as well as scholars and scientists, all of
whom were apparently perfectly willing to be deceived,
and to unwittingly aid in making the careers of these
two adventurers “howling successes” up to the time of
their undoing in the courts.</p>

<p>Unlike Home, who never in all the vicissitudes of his
career denied his personality, Diss Debar as frequently as
she changed her base of operations seems to have changed
her name and her ancestry. Once in the heyday of her
career she gave a series of interviews claiming to be the
daughter of King Louis I of Bavaria and Lola Montez, a
Spanish-Irish dancer who had a spectacular and adventurous
career which covered Europe in its course, reached
to the Russian Court and later America. It is supposed
that Diss Debar was the daughter of a political refugee
by the name of Salomen who settled in Kentucky and
that she was born in 1849 although there is no documentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
proof of it. According to the story she was named
Editha and as she grew up became known as a wayward
child bent on doing what she should not and perfectly
callous to all restraining influence of parental affection.
“At times her waywardness took such extraordinary turns
that her parents thought she was not entirely sane and
sought the advice of a doctor, who said she was really a
sort of victim to an unholy passion, but that she would
grow out of her failing as she grew older,” a prophecy
which never came true.</p>

<p>When Editha Salomen became of age she left home and
for several years her father lost all track of her. Later, to
his great astonishment, he discovered her settled in Baltimore,
moving among the best of society, and posing as a
member of European aristocracy. As the “Countess
Landsfeldt and Baroness Rosenthal” of the peerage of
Bavaria she availed herself of all the privileges which
members of nobility enjoyed in the Republic, was courted
by American youth and found American women “only
too delighted to be led by a Countess.”</p>

<p>Where the Kentucky girl with her peculiar temperament
and characteristics could possibly have secured the
education and knowledge which she displayed through all
her exploits I am at a loss to understand. She must have
inherited a liberal share of shrewdness, together with a
fancy for reading ancient history, and at an early age
realized that although not handsome she possessed some
charm of personality which attracted attention and which
enabled her to pose successfully as a member of the
nobility.</p>

<p>It is said that in this rôle Editha had no difficulty in
raising funds. It was easy to encourage a prosperous
young man into a love trap and make him believe she
would soon marry him. “Then one day she would find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
that she had to pay a large sum of money to meet a necessary
obligation, that her careless bankers in Bavaria had
failed to remit a few hundred thousand dollars, on account
of which she most reluctantly accepted temporary
relief from the rich suitor. She took as much as she
dared and thereafter cut him.” In this way she managed
to cheat the youth of Baltimore out of about a quarter of
a million dollars. She gave herself up to luxury and
extravagance; took freely to smoking cigarettes impregnated
with opium and was soon landed in Bellevue Hospital
suffering from “acute nervous exhaustion.”</p>

<p>One day, just as she was nearly cured, she sprang out
of bed, stabbed an attendant and attempted to kill her
doctor, and several persons were seriously wounded before
she was secured. As a result she was sent to the asylum
for the insane on Ward’s Island, where she was detained
for a year, during which time she showed no traces of
insanity and it was concluded that her attempt at murder
was premeditated; but as she had been committed as insane
with no evidence to controvert it the law was powerless
and she was released.</p>

<p>Her next venture was in the field of hypnotism, where
she was an adept, but now known as Mrs. Messant and a
widow, for though a young doctor, either through fear
or fondness, had married her soon after her discharge from
Ward’s Island, he had survived the marriage less than a
year. As “one can always find fools if one really looks
for them” she had no difficulty in surrounding herself
with dupes but as the widow of an obscure doctor was not
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">persona grata</i> in the circles of high society where the
highest paying fools are to be found she set to work to
find an entrée. Her search was not for long. Soon she
discovered a certain General Diss Debar; a man without
money or “mind of his own” but he filled her need, easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
yielded to her cajoleries and presently Editha Salomen,
Countess Landsfeldt, Baroness Rosenthal, Messant became
Ann O’Delia Diss Debar. As the wife of a general, society
smiled on her again and she lived in comfort. The
rich courted “hypnotism and general humbug and the
wily woman was equal to the requirement.” As time
went on, however, she began to squander the money that
flowed into her coffers. A couple of children were born
to her. People began to tire of hypnotism, her income
waned, and it became necessary for her to set her wits to
work and cast her net for a fresh victim.</p>

<p>This proved to be Luther R. Marsh, a brilliant and
wealthy lawyer of New York City. Mr. Marsh was an
ideal subject for the hypnotizer’s attention. Though a
learned lawyer he was not free from superstition and his
wife had died but a short time before he was discovered
by Diss Debar. At an early opportunity she “received”
messages from his spirit wife which the distinguished
member of the bar accepted as genuine so gratefully and
without question that the woman saw at once that she
had opened up a new field with more and greater possibilities
than she had ever worked before; she realized that
she had gifts which fitted her to be a first class Spiritualistic
medium. Nor was her judgment in error. The
credulous lawyer proved an exceedingly easy mark. Very
quickly she won his full confidence and it was not long
before he invited her to share his hospitality at 166
Madison Avenue. There was no delay in her acceptance.
With the owners’ full consent the home was transformed
into a Spiritualistic Temple in which Ann O’Delia Diss
Debar was the high priestess. Soon it was evident that
there were spirits in profusion and the new medium was
able to produce any type of phenomena desired, even to
spirit painting. The venture was a profound success and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
a flourishing business was developed with an upper-ten
clientele in which Mr. Marsh became the chief and real
victim.</p>

<p>Not only was Mr. Marsh mourning his wife but he had
also lost a little daughter but a short time before and so
when “Eva’s” supposed spirit suggested to him that he
make over his property at 166 Madison Avenue to Diss
Debar the father was ready for the sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The deeds
were drawn and the transfer made but the medium was
prevented from enjoying her booty by legal proceedings
which vigilant relatives of Marsh instituted based on his
mental condition.</p>

<p>Both Ann O’Delia Diss Debar and her husband, General
Diss Debar, were arrested and held on bail for trial.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> As
not infrequently happens in such cases the litigation was
long drawn out and much astonishing evidence produced.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
When placed on the witness stand her first testimony
demonstrated her character. A man by the name of
Salomen had testified that he was her brother. She denied
that he was and declared that he was a vile wretch who
had come to her to borrow money. She admitted to an
inspector afterwards that the man was her brother but
that he would not dare go on the stand against her for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
she knew something about him that would blast him forever
and would not hesitate for a second to tell it if she
needed to.</p>

<p>Another indication of her character is furnished by the
story that in choosing between two lawyers to represent
her in court she not only inquired into their legal ability,
but desired to know about their age and looks as well,
finally deciding upon the younger and better looking.</p>

<p>She testified that all the trouble had been caused by
Mr. Marsh giving her his house and in answer to a question
as to why she did not get money from him instead of
real estate she replied that she had tried to but that he
was very mean with his cash. The last time she had gone
to him for money he had refused it, offering her instead
a deed of his property in Newport. This she had refused
fearing it would get her into more trouble.</p>

<p>During the early part of the trial Diss Debar conceived
the idea of consulting the spirit world in regard to her
own course of action and soon after, on “the advice of
Cicero and his colleagues in council of ten” she returned
the deeds of the Madison Avenue property to Mr. Marsh.</p>

<p>One of the surprises of the trial was the calling by the
prosecuting attorney of a professional illusionist, mesmerist,
and conjuror, Carl Hertz, as a witness to prove
by duplication that the tricks practiced on the unsuspecting
Marsh by Diss Debar were simply applications of the
ordinary laws of physics. This he succeeded in doing to
the satisfaction of the court.</p>

<p>While Hertz was exhibiting “spirit message” reading
on the stand Diss Debar did everything in her power to
embarrass him but without success as he met every condition
she suggested including some under which Diss
Debar herself would have failed to “manifest.” Mrs.
Hertz had been her husband’s assistant in reading the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
billets. Diss Debar proposed through her lawyer that
she be allowed to take her place. Hertz readily consented.
The Judge examined a fresh piece of paper and Hertz
passed it to Diss Debar who deliberately tore it in
two pieces and handing one of them back said to Hertz:</p>

<p>“I always mark mine; now let me see you do the trick
with one of these pieces.”</p>

<p>Hertz availed himself of the regular mediumistic subterfuge
“unfavorable conditions” explaining that it was only
a trick and being exhibited as such. To this Diss Debar
retorted:</p>

<p>“I rest my honor upon its <em>all being done by Spiritual
power</em> when I do it.”</p>

<p>At this the court ordered her from the stand refusing to
allow discussion along such lines. Later in the trial Hertz
was recalled to the stand by Diss Debar’s counsel and
asked if he could produce the trick with Mr. Marsh as an
assistant. He replied that he “could and would.” From
a newspaper account<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> we learn that excitement in the
courtroom ran high while he proceeded with the trick.
Diss Debar told Marsh to “mark the tablet.”</p>

<p>The conditions were not favorable to the performance
of a sleight-of-hand trick. Mr. Marsh and Mr. Hertz
were less than two feet apart and people crowded around
so close that the magician scarcely had room to move, and
yet he succeeded completely in deceiving Mr. Marsh.
When Hertz handed the tablet to Mr. Marsh he calmly
said:</p>

<p>“If you wish to tear a corner off the tablet so as to
identify it, I have no objections.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marsh tore the corner off the tablet, nevertheless
he was completely tricked, and he so admitted to the
court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>Nothing could show more clearly the methods used by
mediums than the following account, written by Hertz
himself, of the means which he used in the demonstration
described above. The letter was in response to one of
mine in which I asked him to let me know the method
he used as I thought it should be put in this record.</p>

July 16, 1923.
</p>

<p class="in0">Dear Houdini:</p>

<p>I am in receipt of yours, with reference to the manner
in which I manipulated the paper to fool Mme. Diss
Debar. I worked it as follows: When she was in the
witness box, I showed the jury and Mrs. Diss Debar a half
sheet of plain white note paper with nothing on it. I
then told her to examine it and fold it four times (I had
a duplicate piece with a communication written on it
palmed in my hand), when she handed it back to me, I
quickly made the changes, and giving her the piece with
the writing on it I told her to hold it against my forehead.
She then stopped me and said: “<em>one moment please</em>,
whenever I do this trick, <em>I let them mark the paper</em>,” and
suiting the action to the word, she took the paper, and
without opening it again, she tore a corner off the blank
piece, but, as it was already changed it made no difference.</p>

<p>You will see, I took a big chance, but it came off. I
had an idea she would do this, so I actually changed the
papers before I should have done so in the ordinary way,
and she was flabbergasted when she opened the paper
and found a communication written upon it, and on the
same piece of paper which she had marked.</p>

<p>The writing pad trick which I did in the witness box
with Luther R. Marsh, I did as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>The trick, if you remember, was to show a pad of about
a hundred sheets of paper unwritten upon, and to wrap
the pad up in a newspaper, and to allow Marsh to hold
one end while she held the other. Then the sound of
writing was heard as if some one was writing on the paper,
and when the newspaper was opened every sheet in the
pad was written upon.</p>

<p>I had two pads alike, one I had concealed under my waist-coat,
and the other I gave to Marsh to examine; as I proceeded
to wrap the pad up, under cover of the newspaper, I
changed them, quickly drawing the pad from my waist-coat
and leaving the other one in its place.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to wrap the pad up when Diss Debar
shouted from her seat in the Court Room ‘Don’t let him
fool you, mark it!’ but as it was already changed, it did
not matter so I let them tear a corner off.</p>

<p>I then let him hold one end, while I held the other, and
amidst a great silence the sound of writing was heard, as
if a pen was rapidly going over the paper, and I then told
him to open the newspaper and look at the pad, when he
found every sheet written upon.</p>

<p>I then showed the Court how I produced the sound of
writing, by having the nail of my forefinger split, and
simply scratching the newspaper underneath while I held
it.</p>

<p>Kind regards to self and wife from both of us.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
(Signed)   <span class="smcap insig">Carl Hertz</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Regardless of Carl Hertz’s testimony and demonstration
Mr. Marsh’s belief in the genuineness of Spiritualistic
phenomena was unshaken and remained so until the time
of his death. Not only the extent of this belief and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
mental condition, but his confidence in Diss Debar as well,
are revealed in the following excerpt from the <cite>New York
Times’s</cite> account of the trial.</p>

<p>“A short communication from St. Paul was read by
Mr. Howe (the Prosecuting Attorney) to the Court, and
Mr. Marsh read a very long one from St. Peter. It required
fifteen minutes and a half to read this communication,
and Mr. Marsh said it had come in the tablet written
in two minutes. Judge Cross and Luther Colby were in
his study when it came. He knew that the tablet was
blank before he and Mme. Diss Debar held it together in
their hands.</p>

<p>“Mr. Howe asked Mr. Marsh if he really believed the
communication was from St. Peter, the apostle, and Mr.
Marsh replied that he knew it was.</p>

<p>“‘Then you still believe in it!’ exclaimed Mr. Howe.</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ was the firm reply, and the Spiritualistic element
applauded vigorously. Mme. Diss Debar and Mr.
Marsh both seemed pleased with this demonstration which
the Court, however, stopped summarily.”</p>

<p>Twelve ballots were taken by the jury before an agreement
was reached due to the fact that one juror, evidently
in sympathy with the accused, obstinately held out for
acquittal. His reasons were as little logical as most
Spiritualistic arguments and had no connection with the
evidence. In fact the other jurors said that when they
tried to talk evidence to him “he wouldn’t have it, but
hung to one line of thought, namely, that he believed
Mrs. Diss Debar to be the daughter of Lola Montez and
that a woman born out of wedlock was just as much entitled
to consideration as one who was born in wedlock,
and as Mrs. Ann O’Delia Diss Debar claimed
all the honors of illegitimacy, he was on her side for
keeps.”</p>

  <div class="caption">ANN O’DELIA DISS DEBAR</div></div>

<p>Finally after a long wrangle and with the prospect of
being locked in a jury room over Sunday, an arrangement
was reached whereby a verdict of guilty was to be
brought in but with a recommendation for clemency.
This was done and Diss Debar and her husband were
sent to Blackwell’s Island for six months.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>When she was released she disappeared from America
only to reappear after a little in London, England, where
under the names of Laura and Theodore Jackson she
and her husband soon found themselves in trouble for
starting an exceptionally immoral cult<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> which they
called a “Theocratic Unity.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> She was sentenced in December,
1901, to seven years of penal servitude in Aylesbury
Prison. Even here her persuasive powers found a
use for it is said that she gained favor because of the marvellous
influence which she had over the refractory element
which the officers in charge had difficulty in keeping
in subjection. At any rate she was released after serving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
five years, “having obtained the maximum reduction of
sentence for good behavior.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>Out in the world again she ventured into vaudeville and
afterwards burlesque but in these rôles she was a complete
failure. Later she came back to America and was next
heard of in Chicago as Vera Ava. She succeeded in marrying
a wealthy man there but before long was in more
difficulties in connection with the pursuit of spookery and
sentenced to the Joliet Penitentiary for two years.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Once
more she appeared—in New Orleans as the Baroness
Rosenthal—then in 1909 this creature, who for more than
a quarter of a century had been swaying men of prominence
and women of society, dropped out of sight and
for the last fifteen years nothing has been known about
her.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>In mothering this immoral woman, Spiritualism is
guilty of the grossest misconduct and proves conclusively
that she does not protect her own from the wiles and immorality
of mediums even though they are found guilty
of base criminality by the courts. Were I permitted to go
into detail I could tell tales of Diss Debar that would
shock even the worst roué of the Montmartre. Suffice to
say that her crimes were not so much crimes of gain
as they were insults to the decency and morality of the
community.</p>

<p>Ann O’Delia Diss Debar’s reputation<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> was such that she
will go down in history as one of the great criminals.
She was no credit to Spiritualism; she was no credit to
any people, she was no credit to any country—she was
one of these moral misfits which every once in awhile seem
to find their way into the world. Better far had she died
at birth than to have lived and spread the evil she did.</p>

<span class="subhead">DR. SLADE AND HIS SPIRIT SLATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Slate</span> writing was an especially fortunate “find” for
mediums. Its results were obtained in full light and the
whole thing seemed so simple and direct that apparently
there was nothing to investigate and comparatively speaking
there were no blank seances. Such success led to
carelessness and exposures followed, so numerous and
complete that it is quite unnecessary to list them all here.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
Every once in a while though some medium still takes a
chance when opportunity offers and gives a test to especially
gullible sitters, but to-day no medium with any
pretentions to “class” would think of anything so “common”
as slate writing in its old form. Spirit slates are
now listed in the catalogues of houses dealing in conjuring
apparatus and the fraud mediums who formerly made use
of them are employing the safer and easier swindles of
automatic writing, trance or trumpet messages, and the
“ouija board.”</p>

<p>The infinite grafting possibilities of the Spirit slates
seem to have been overlooked until adopted and put into
usable form by Dr. Henry Slade,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> a man who had acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
an unenviable reputation in New York City, but it is
extremely doubtful if the present generation would have
known anything about Dr. Slade had the perpetuation of
his name been left to the quality of his mediumship, for he
was only one of a large number of conjuring fakirs who
bamboozled the credulous of his day. However, he was
brought into the limelight on two notable occasions: first by
being exposed and criminally prosecuted in London; and
second when poor old Professor Zollner, a noted German
astronomer and physicist, “fell” for his simple conjuring
and fell so hard that he made Slade the hero of his great
(?) work, “Transcendental Physics.”</p>

<p>Like D. D. Home, and many others, after making a
reputation in America, Slade jumped over to London, for
England’s arms seem ever open for the reception of
mediums who have made good here and if a medium
escapes the toils of American investigators he has little to
fear from willing believers on the other side of the Atlantic,
though as a matter of fact several were sent to jail
there. Slade reached England in July, 1876, and began
to hold sittings at once, and was soon “cleaning up” in
fine shape. The late John Nevil Maskelyne, the great
English magician, told me that:</p>

<p>“Crowds of people rushed to witness the phenomena
(?) paying one guinea each for a sitting lasting but a few
minutes. You would think they were giving gold guineas
away. The ‘Doctor’ must have netted some hundreds of
pounds weekly which in those days was rated a high sum
of money for an individual ‘performer.’”</p>

<p>Then, just as things were going so nicely for Slade
there came a sudden crash, for which two men were
responsible; Professor Ray Lankester (now Sir Ray Lankester)
and Dr. Horatio Donkin (now Sir Horatio Donkin).
These men applied certain effective methods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
scrutiny to Slade’s exhibitions which resulted in his arrest.
The trial created a big sensation, not only in Spiritual
circles, but throughout the civilized world, and the Bow
Street Court was the most popular show in London for
several days; the “top-liner” being J. N. Maskelyne, the
magician, who performed all of Slade’s tricks in the witness
box.</p>

<p>Slade was convicted and sentenced to three months at
hard labor. An appeal was taken and the decision quashed
on account of a flaw in the indictment. While Sir Lankester
was procuring new summonses for Slade and his
manager, Simmons, they both skipped across the channel
into France, thus closing the doors of England against
Slade for all time as he never dared to set foot on her unfriendly
shores again. He made ready for a Paris performance
but a friend of Sir Lankester’s sent an account
of the court proceedings to the Paris press so the French
people had the whole story before Slade was able to begin.</p>

<p>While touring Europe in 1920 I had the pleasure of
meeting Sir Ray Lankester and hearing from him an account
of Dr. Slade’s undoing. Both he and Donkin were
physicians. They had been laying their plans to expose
two other mediums, Herne and Williams, but Slade’s unexpected
arrival in London changed these plans and instead
they plotted the seance which proved to be Slade’s
downfall. Donkin was away from London at the time but
Sir Lankester wired him and while waiting for his return
attended one of Slade’s seances. He pretended to Slade
that he came to see if the Spirits would write a message on
the slates if he held them himself. Slade assured him
that they would and arrangements were made for a second
sitting. Before Sir Lankester left Slade asked him if he
had been in communication with any departed relatives.</p>

<p>“No, but I have an Uncle John,” Sir Lankester replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Consequently at the second sitting the following message
was received:</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you here again.—John.”</p>

<p>“But have you an Uncle John?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, Houdini,” he replied smiling, “that is why everyone
laughed in the courtroom at the time of the trial.
You see, Slade thought I was a firm believer, and I allowed
him to distract my attention. He said to me ‘You
have a great deal of mediumistic power about you. I see
them over you behind your head.’”</p>

<p>As he said this Sir Lankester raised his head with seeming
credulity acting the part splendidly.</p>

<p>“What made you suspect Slade?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“At the first seance I noticed the tendons move on
Slade’s wrist as he held his hand outstretched under the
table,” Sir Lankester replied, “and while making a number
of suspicious moves he scratched the slates a number
of times with his finger nail to simulate the noise made by
a slate pencil when writing on a slate.”</p>

<p>On the return of Sir Donkin it was arranged that he
and Sir Lankester should attend a seance together and
that Sir Donkin was to watch for the “suspicious move”
and when he saw it signal Sir Lankester. Everything
worked as planned. On receiving the agreed signal from
Donkin, Lankester seized the slate containing the finished
message proving that a skillful exchange of slates had been
made by Slade and this was the <em>real evidence which caused
the downfall of Henry Slade</em> in England.</p>

<p>Blocked in Paris from working his tricks because of the
publication of an account of his exposure in England
Slade seems to have gone to Germany for it was during
the next year, 1877, that he so successfully deluded Professor
Zollner. “Zollner” is one of the names on which
Spiritualistic enthusiasts bank most heavily for proof of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
their claims. Even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to this day
quotes Zollner as indisputable authority. Nevertheless
Zollner is discredited by Mr. George S. Fullerton, Secretary
of the Seybert Commission. While in Germany Mr.
Fullerton made a special business of investigating the
value of this Zollner endorsement, and at the time all of
the men who participated in the Slade investigation were
alive with the exception of Zollner himself. Mr. Fullerton
in the summary of his report to the Commission said:</p>

<p>“Thus it would appear that of the four eminent men
whose names have made famous the investigation, there
is reason to believe one, Zollner, was of unsound mind at
the time, and anxious for experimental verification of an
already accepted hypothesis; another, Fechner, was partially
blind and <em>believed</em> because of Zollner’s observation;
a third, Scheibner, was also afflicted with defective vision
and not entirely satisfied in his own mind with the phenomena;
and a fourth, Weber, was advanced in age, and
did not even recognize the disabilities of his associates.
None of the men named had any previous experience or
knowledge of the possibilities of deception.”</p>

<p>The Seybert Commission, in 1884, seems to have made
the first systematic, organized effort to fathom the so-called
phenomena of Spiritualism, and this Commission
sent for Slade, who was then operating in New York, and
had him give a number of seances under their observation,
but in spite of the fact that Slade gave the Commission
a personal letter thanking them for their courtesies
and expressing his willingness to sit with them again, the
Commission considered his work fraudulent throughout.</p>

<p>At a very early stage of the sittings, the Commission
noticed two kinds of communications. Those in answer
to questions were slovenly written, often illegible, while
those which came as voluntary contributions from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Spirits, were more carefully written, even to punctuation.
It was very evident that this writing on the slates had been
prepared previous to the sitting, while that written under
the restraint of observation was the crude scrawl, abrupt
in composition, and often almost or quite illegible. It
was evident that where the nicely written communications
were used an exchange of slates had been effected,
whereas the other writing was the result of such skill as
could be brought to bear without detection under the
unfavorable conditions. It was also noticed that all of
the long messages most suspiciously resembled the handwriting
of the medium. Every test to which Slade submitted
proved to be transparent to the Commission and
some of his efforts to mystify it were referred to as:</p>

<p>“Several little tricks which he imputed to Spiritual
agency, but which were almost puerile in the simplicity
of their legerdemain, and which have been repeated with
perfect success by one of our number.”</p>

<p>After all the slate-writing mediums who came in answer
to an advertisement broadcasted by the Seybert
Commission had been examined by it, the acting Chairman
of the Commission, Mr. Horace Howard Furness, invited
the late Harry Kellar to exhibit his slate-writing skill before
it, not with any claim to supernatural phenomena but
as a magician openly admitting his purpose to baffle by
purely natural means. Mr. Kellar submitted to a series of
tests far more complicated and difficult of execution than
any produced by Slade or any other medium; nevertheless
the Commission was unable to detect his methods and admitted
itself completely baffled.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellar told me that when Mr. Furness, and Coleman
Sellers, another member of the Commission who
was himself an amateur entertainer, applied to him for
an exhibition of his skill as a slate-writer they expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
him to do the stock tricks of Slade. But someone tipped
Kellar off that Sellers had told the members of the Commission
what Kellar was to do and his probable method
of doing it and for them to watch out for his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus
operandi</i>. So, not to be “caught napping,” Kellar, like
the skillful mystifier that he was, determined to out-do Slade
and beat Sellers. As he told me about it he laughed
heartily, saying:</p>

<p>“If you could have seen Mr. Sellers’ face at the time
of the unfolding of the mystery, it would have done your
heart good.”</p>

<p>When Kellar arrived for the demonstration he insisted
that the Commission furnish its own slates, so a boy was
sent out who brought back about a dozen of various kinds.
Then all sat down around the table with hands resting,
palm down, on its top. The Commission opened the
sitting by writing questions on the slates. Kellar held
them under the table with the thumb on top and when he
withdrew them in a few moments they had answers to
the questions written in a clear round hand. The questions
gradually became longer and longer, but the replies
kept pace with them, sometimes covering a whole side
of the slate. Although the slates were all different and
could not possibly be mistaken for one another, the Commission
began to put identifying marks on them. Once
no pencil was put on the top of the slate but the reply
came just the same. This fact was commented upon and
Kellar replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, my Spirits can write <em>without</em> pencils,” a statement
which puzzled the members of the Commission all the
more.</p>

<p>Finally the magician asked them to write a question on
a slate and cover it with another, placing the pencil between
the two. Even this did not bother the “Spirits,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
for when the slates were returned, both sides were found
covered with writing.</p>

<p>The following extract from the Preliminary Report of
the Seybert Commission, originally published in 1887,
describes this performance of Harry Kellar before members
of the Commission and shows the impression which
it made on them.</p>

<p>“An eminent professional juggler performed, in the
presence of three of our Commission, some independent
slate-writing far more remarkable than any of which we
have witnessed with mediums. In broad daylight, a slate
perfectly clean on both sides, was, with a small fragment
of slate pencil, held under a leaf of a small, ordinary
table, around which we were seated; the fingers of the
juggler’s hand pressed the slate tight against the underside
of the leaf, while the thumb completed the pressure
and remained in full view clasping the leaf of the table.
Our eyes never for the fraction of a second lost sight of
that thumb; it never moved; and yet in a few minutes the
slate was produced, covered with writing. Messages were
there, and still are there, for we preserved the slate,
written in French, Spanish, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese,
Gujorati, and ending with ‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">ich bin ein Geist, und lieb,
mein Lagerbier</i>.’ For one of our number the juggler
subsequently repeated the trick and revealed its every
detail.”</p>

<p>The method which Kellar used, and which he described
to me, was this. With the consent of the owner of the
hotel, whom he agreed to pay for any damage, he had a
small trap made in the floor of the room, about as large
as a hot air register, with the necessary means of opening
and closing it. A plush rug with rectangular designs was
placed over this trap, and one of the designs, which was
just the size of the trap, was cut out with a razor, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
cuts being imperceptible. The piece of rug was glued
firmly to the top of the trap. In addition to these preparations,
Kellar bought a specimen of every variety of
slate to be found in the downtown section of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>When the time for the “seance” arrived, Barney,
Kellar’s clever young assistant, was seated on a platform
in the room underneath the trap with the assortment of
slates by his side. As soon as the Commission was seated
around the table he opened the trap and could then hear
all that was said in the room above. When the exhibition
commenced he simply took the slate Kellar put under
the table leaf, selected one from his assortment to match
it, wrote on it the answer, and then slipped it under
Kellar’s fingers. In the case of a marked slate he used
that instead of a duplicate. Of course it was perfectly
easy for Kellar to do his part without removing his thumb
from the top of the table.</p>

<p>“A fake, pure and simple, you will say,” Kellar remarked
to me, and then added, “but that’s what all
Spiritualistic manifestations are.”</p>

<p>In point of time John W. Truesdell was probably the
first exposer of Slade as he investigated him as early as
1872, but the results of his investigation were not made
public until he published his book, “Bottom Facts,” in
1883. In this book he tells of setting a trap for Slade
and proving that he substituted slates.</p>

<p>As Sam Johnson of Rome, N. Y., Truesdell arranged
for a seance with Slade. Knowing that his overcoat
would be searched, he left it hanging on the hall rack with
an unsealed letter in the pocket and while waiting in the
Spirit room he made the most of his opportunity to look
around. Under the sideboard he found a slate with a
message written on the lower side which read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are happy to meet you in this atmosphere of Spirit
research. You are now summoned by many anxious
friends in the Spirit life, who desire to communicate with
you, but who cannot until they learn more of the laws
which govern their actions. If you will come here often,
your Spirit friends will soon be able to identify themselves
and to communicate with you as on earth life.</p>

<p class="sigright">“Allie.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a bold hand Truesdell added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Henry, look out for this fellow. He is up to snuff.</p>

<p class="sigright p0">“Alcinda.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the name of Slade’s deceased wife, a fact
which Truesdell happened to know. He replaced the
slate as he had found it. Slade presently appeared and
the seance began with the general phenomena of moving
chairs, etc., preceding the slate-writing. When the name
“Mary Johnson” appeared plainly written on the slate
Slade said it was Truesdell’s sister. Upon being told
that this was incorrect, Slade, pretending to change the
light, drew the table over by the sideboard. As usual he
<em>lost control</em> of the slate, letting it fall to the floor, and as
he stooped over to pick it up took the prepared one
instead. When he read the two messages he became livid
with rage and turning to Truesdell demanded to know
what it meant and who had been meddling with the slate.</p>

<p>“Spirits,” was Truesdell’s reply.</p>

<p>There were a few tense seconds and then the seance
continued serenely.</p>

<p>I was too young in Slade’s time to seek an audience
with him but I have the good fortune to know Mr. Frederick
E. Powell, a prominent magician and a member of
the Society of American Magicians. He is one of the very
few persons now living who had seances with Slade and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
with his permission I quote the following description of
his experiences with Slade.</p>

  <div class="caption">HENRY SLADE</div></div>

<p>“In the Autumn of 1881 or 82, Henry Slade, the famous
Spirit medium, came to Philadelphia and took quarters
at the Colonade Hotel, where he opened a room, in
which to hold seances. At that time I was instructor of
Mathematics in the Pennsylvania Military College at
Chester, Pa. Reading the announcement of Slade’s
seances in a Philadelphia paper, I wrote to him, and made
an appointment for myself and Capt. R. K. Carter, to be
present at one of them. Capt. Carter was at that time
our instructor in Civil Engineering. Reaching the Colonade
at the appointed time, we were ushered into Slade’s
presence, in a room, bare of furniture, save a rather long
table and several chairs, placed in the center of the room,
while at the side and just back of where Slade was to sit,
was a smaller table on which were piled a number of
ordinary looking school slates, of various sizes. The
center table had no cloth on it. Several small articles
were on the mantelpiece, such as a smoker might use,
viz.: a match box, etc.</p>

<p>“According to my recollection, Slade was rather tall
and slim, and of an ingratiating presence. He was expecting
us and at once placed me at a long table.</p>

<p>“The seance began, with Slade holding two slates of
rather large size, and showing all their surfaces devoid
of writing, placed them on the top of the table, and while
rubbing their surfaces kept up a running fire of conversation.
He then told us to place our hands on the table
as near the center as possible with our little fingers touching.
Slade placed the slates together, and after a moment
or two separated them, saying he had forgotten to put a
piece of pencil between. This he did, and holding them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
together placed them under the table with one hand, while
he placed the other on the table so that his fingers touched
our hands. This position was held for several minutes,
when he said he would see if he had gotten any results.
Bringing the slates from under the table he laid them
on top and after a moment told Capt. Carter to look at
them. Following this direction, Capt. Carter separated
them, when one was found to have its entire surface
covered with writing. This message, according to Slade,
came from a man who had just died. (Notice of the
man’s death had been published in the morning paper.)
The message was signed with the full name, but as neither
Capt. Carter nor I knew the man, we could not affirm
or deny the correctness of the handwriting, nor the truth
of the signature.</p>

<p>“Capt. Carter asked Slade if he might copy the message,
but Slade demurred, saying he did not know if the
Spirits would like the message copied. I found it difficult
to account for the reticence of the Spirit or Spirits since
the message had been written for our information. Its
purport was, as far as I can recall, that everything was
very glorious in the Spirit World, and that he, the writer,
was very happy. There was nothing in the message that
was above the mentality of Slade or that was, in any sense,
descriptive of Spirit Life. All was vague and unsatisfactory,
where real information was desired.</p>

<p>“During this demonstration and indeed throughout the
entire seance, Slade sat sidewise to the table, his left
hand resting generally on its top and his right hand free.
Several short messages were next produced on a small
slate held by Slade, under the table, and out of sight,
a short piece of slate pencil always being placed on the
upper surface of the slate. Two points were made very
emphatic by Slade. First, that the piece of pencil was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
always found just at the end of the last word of the
message, and second, that the messages were found on
the upper side of the slate, which according to Slade was
held close against the under surface of the table top.
However, as we could not see the slate when placed under
the table, since we were reaching as far as we could to
get our hands on the center of its top, and the slate was
only shown to us when being brought from under its
surface, it would have been an easy thing to lower the
slate after placing it under the table and writing with a
single finger of Slade’s right hand, then bringing the slate
to the under surface of the table, bring it slowly into
sight.</p>

<p>“Once when the small slate was laid on top of the table
the sound of writing was distinctly heard. During this
time Slade had both hands on the upper surface of the
table and in full sight. This was quite startling at the
time, but later I discovered how to produce this sound of
writing myself and without the aid of Spirits.</p>

<p>“Once, while we were having our attention directed to
a slate held by Slade, the unoccupied chair on the side
opposite to Slade and almost at the side of Capt. Carter,
suddenly rose so that its seat struck the under side of the
table, and then fell back with quite a thud.</p>

<p>“Another telling effect was carried out, when Slade
gave me one of the small slates telling me to hold it
under the table. I did so and felt it suddenly snatched
from my hand (I was holding it with one hand, my other
hand was on the top of the table) and carried with a
scraping noise to the very end of the table and there it
rose above the surface enough to disclose about a third
or possibly a half its length. Then it was carried swiftly
back and put in my hand.</p>

<p>“This concluded the first seance; when Slade, after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
moment, said he thought that was all he could get at
the time.</p>

<p>“On our second visit I need recount but three effects:
First, difference in the method of obtaining writing on
the large slates which began the seance, as in the first
visit. Slade showed one slate and cleaned it thoroughly,
then while keeping up a running fire of conversation, he
casually reached to the small table, spoken of as having
several piles of slates on it, and taking one as though at
hazard, placed it flat on the big table. Rubbed its upper
surface with his fingers, and placed a piece of pencil on
it, held it under the table. After a pause he brought it
out and taking the upper slate off the under, showed both
surfaces without writing. He remarked that perhaps a
different piece of pencil would be better and he placed
another pencil on the upper surface of the top slate and
then placed the lower slate over it, without at any time
having shown its under surface. This surface was found
covered with writing, the purport of which I do not now
recall.</p>

<p>“The second variation of the first seance was when
Slade asked me if I had ever seen the ‘dematerialization
of a solid object?’ I said I had not, whereupon Slade
took a small slate and, looking around as though to find
a proper object for his test, picked up a match box from
the mantelpiece, and put it on the upper surface of the
slate rather close to where he would hold it. He then
placed the slate and its superimposed object carefully
under the table and after a moment brought out the slate,
without the match box. I looked under the table but
found nothing suspicious there.</p>

<p>“In a moment Slade replaced the slate under the table
and on bringing it out, we saw the match box in its former
place. This disappearance did not impress me greatly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
I concluded the whole secret of dematerialization consisted
in turning the slate over and holding the box in place
by a finger, then after showing the surface empty, the
slate was again turned over on being replaced under the
table, and so the materialization of the box was realized.</p>

<p>“The last test was quite startling. Slade drew his
chair close to mine, placed one of his hands on the chair
back and the other on the table. My hands were resting
on the table top. Suddenly I felt the chair rise, and I
was tipped forward, but kept my balance by pushing back
with my hands, which, as I have said, were resting on
the table top. Then the force was quickly withdrawn
and my chair and I came back to the floor with a grand
thud. This concluded the second seance. I never saw
Slade again.”</p>

<p>Powell explains the levitation thus:</p>

<p>“When Slade drew his chair close to mine he crossed
his legs and was thus enabled to bring his foot under the
rung of my chair. The leg resting over the knee gave
considerable leverage to the limb having a foot under
the rung of my chair. Now he exerted the necessary
strength by pressing upward with his foot, and holding
the chair back with his hand while the other hand steadied
the whole, by bearing against the table. Slade took his
hand away from the back of my chair for the fraction
of a second <em>before he released his foot</em>. I was thus naturally
tilted forward and had to exert some force to keep
myself from sliding off the chair. This effort kept me
from seeing Slade free himself and get his limbs back to
their normal position, viz., one hand on the table, and his
feet and legs fairly under it. Slade was rather tall and,
though somewhat slim, was very muscular. Of course I
did not actually <em>see</em> Slade use his foot to do the lifting,
but his position and all the circumstances surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the effect tend to prove my claim as to what I believe
he did. Further, while I was far from being as strong
as Slade, I succeeded in duplicating this ‘Levitation’ by
the means I have described.”</p>

<p>While searching for material about Slade I heard of an
old medium living in Philadelphia by the name of
Remigius Weiss, known as Remigius Albus, who had
testified before the Seybert Commission regarding Slade’s
manipulation of the slates. I went over to Philadelphia
to his home and there met the only man who had tangible
evidence of Dr. Slade. This he thoroughly explained
to me. I asked him why he had never exposed it to the
world and he told me that he held back at first because
of pity for Slade’s condition and afterwards figured that
if the fraud mediums and other potential criminals knew
Slade’s methods they might make use of the methods to
gain control of poor human beings who wished to get in
touch with loved ones who had passed away. He did
not hesitate to give me full details and at my request
wrote me a letter describing his experience with Slade. I
quote it because I believe it to be the best exposé ever
written of Slade’s slate writings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">“August 18, 1923.</p>

<p class="in0">“My dear <span class="locked">Houdini:—</span></p>

<p>“Please accept, from me, this Lock-book, and the
locked double-slate—as a small token of comradeship—in
combating Spiritualistic deception, popular superstition
and Delusion.</p>

<p>“The book and the slate were my own. I put the lock
and hinges on the slate, and prepared the book, and a
number of other, different objects—(such as Professor
Zollner had, when he, in his foolishness, was pleased to
be deceived by Dr. Slade’s Humbug).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>“In order to gain the perfect, full confidence of Dr.
Slade, and to have him give a seance in my home, and
in order to counteract and overcome his explicit aversion
as to do writing on or between a sealed slate or a locked
book—I showed him letters from (two eminent and confiding
Spiritist Authors)—Dr. Heinrich Tiedemann and
Tiedemann’s intimate friend Hudson Tuttle, promising to
me that they would be present at that seance (at 148
Fairmount Avenue).</p>

<p>“Dr. Slade had handled and inspected that Book and
Slate, during a Seance, at my residence (at 148 Fairmount
Avenue, Phila., Pa.), where I, together with Mr.
Wertheimer (then a student of Jurisprudence)—and in
presence of other witnesses (who were concealed and not
seen, nor suspected by Dr. Slade, nor his ‘Spirits’) detected
the manipulations, pedalations (foot, leg and other
bodily movements)—and the general <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i> of
his simple Legerdemain at the seance. I had ready, for
that seance, three different suites of Furniture, and thus,
I found out that he would, or could, perform only at, or
on a certain kind of plain, square or drop-leaf table and
ordinary wooden chairs or cane seat chairs.</p>

<p>“Each person present at the Seance, wrote, <em>independent</em>
of and <em>before</em> communicating with, the others, a personal,
individual report of the Seance and signed it within the
next few days. A day or two after, I put these papers in
my pocket and also another paper I had prepared, to serve
or use as Dr. Slade’s confession to be signed by him.
I went to the Girard Hotel, Room 24 (N. W. corner of
9th and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, Pa.), to have
Dr. Slade arrested for obtaining money under false pretense,—or
to get him to sign his own confession. There,
in his room, No. 24, in the Girard Hotel, I had another,
a different Seance, with Dr. Slade. He again carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
scrutinized the book and the slate, and then, holding the
book under the table, secretly and carefully, attempted
to open the lock, with a small key, hidden in his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Dr. Slade and his pretended ‘<em>Spirits</em>’ could not write
in the book. While holding it under the table, he attempted
to pull out of the book that thin, wooden, square
frame, I had put there at the edges of the leaves so that
the small piece of lead pencil could move about.—Then,
in a similar attempt, he worked and perspired, on, and
over the double slate. His ‘Spirits’ could not write in
the locked slate and he could not open it.</p>

<p>“He said, ‘The Spirits seem to be angry at your skepticism,
it’s no use to lose more time by trying. My guide
don’t want to have anything more to do with you.’</p>

<p>“Then upon Dr. Slade’s request I unlocked the slate,
and he wrote in the ordinary way, as writing generally
is done in schools, two short sentences in the slate. Then
he worked the sponge,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> and turning the written on side
downward, sleight-of-hand trick, tried to palm this off,
claiming that this is ‘Genuine, independent, Spirit slate
writing.’</p>

<p>“Up to this time, November the 4th, 1882, I had
shown to Dr. Slade friendly, joyful attentiveness. We
talked about some of my newspaper articles I had published
some weeks before he consented to give me a seance.</p>

<p>“In these newspapers I had described him (Dr. Slade)
as ‘The Modern Cagliostro, a celebrated necromancer,
martyr or a charlatan, of radical free-religious proclivities,
fine manners and a humistic, witty and forceful public
lecturer and most powerful Spiritistic Medium, who again
and again has been and is challenging exposures, and
calling special attention to the fact that Dr. Slade has,
in his lectures, and otherwise, again and again publicly
announced that he is prepared to pay a thousand dollars
($1000.00) to any person that can prove that he (Dr.
Slade) is a humbug, or that Dr. Slade’s “manifestations”
are trickery, legerdemain, humbug or in any way
fraudulent.’</p>

  <div class="caption">“LOCKED SLATE” USED BY DR. HENRY SLADE IN HIS WRITING TESTS AT PHILADELPHIA</div></div>

<p>“Dr. Slade seemed to be pleased by my description.
After some pleasant talk as to his appearance with Scientists,
Kings and other royal persons and Rulers in Europe
and his success as a lecturer and his way of living, he
gave me his address, No. 221 West 22nd Street, <i>New
York</i>.</p>

<p>“Then I asked Dr. Slade that we change ‘rôles,’ he to
take my place and be the Investigator,—and I to play
the ‘medium,’ there, in his room, as an ‘experiment.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Slade also said that if I could overcome my skepticism
I would be a good ‘psychic,’ having ‘mediumistic’
gifts.</p>

<p>“I suggested that he should watch me carefully and
then honestly tell me, as to the effect and ‘impression’
my ‘manifestations’ could (or would) be producing on his
mind, and eventually on the outcome of the ‘Spiritualistic,
the Harmonial, Philosophy, or so-called, Scientific Religion
of the Spiritists.’</p>

<p>“Then, to his consternation, I, earnestly, by actual
demonstration, reproduced every one of his manifestations,
<em>exactly</em> (and by the same <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i>, as I,
and my witnesses had seen and detected) as <em>Dr. Slade
had performed them</em>. He asked me, how, and by what
means we detected his ‘occult’ or secret mode, or ‘process
of wonder working’ or miracle?—I mentioned that he had
positively refused to try any ‘experiment’ on the first and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
second sets of tables and chairs, and had requested me
to substitute them by a plain kitchen table and chairs
of a certain construction.</p>

<p>“I told him that I had bored observation-holes in the
<em>corners</em> of the panels (particularly so through the <em>lower</em>
corners) in the parlor doors, the floor, ceiling and other
places from where my concealed witnesses observed, and
have seen exactly all the movements of his feet, hands,
etc., <em>below</em> and above the table,—saw how he raised
(‘floated’) Mr. Wertheimer sitting in the chair, saw how
he (Dr. Slade) with his foot upset chairs, kicked a book
(extending over the edge of the table), tossed a slate
pencil from the edge of the table from a slate held under
and at the edge of the table, etc., etc.</p>

<p>“Dr. Slade, now turned very pale and wiping off the
thick perspiration from his forehead and face, said:—‘Well,
what of it?’ and rashly asked:—‘Where were Hudson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Tuttle and Dr. H. Tiedemann?’ I reminded him of
the fact that they had sent an excuse, being unable (by
reason of unforeseen circumstances) to attend that seance
in my house.</p>

<p>“Then I sternly gave him the alternative:—That either
he <em>sign his own confession</em> (as to the fact)—that he has
(during the many years in his career as a professional
Spirit medium and in everything he had professed or
pretended to be ‘genuine’ Spiritistic or Spiritualistic)
deceived and defrauded the public.—I read the confession
to him and sternly demanded, ‘Either you sign this or
you will be put behind the <span class="locked">bars.’—</span></p>

<span class="subhead">SLATE WRITING AND
OTHER METHODS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A remarkably</span> large number of methods have been
used at one time and another by the numerous mediums
of lesser repute than Slade who prospered on slate writing.
Slade himself, like any skilled prestidigitator, had a
variety of ways which he used to produce his effects. His
usual method was very simple. A common kitchen table
with the leaves extended was used, the Doctor being seated
at the end and the client on the side against the leaf, at
the Doctor’s right.</p>

<p>After the slate had been thoroughly washed on both
sides he placed it under the leaf at the left of the sitter,
holding it in position with the fingers of his right hand,
with his thumb above the table. The sitter was requested
to hold the left end of the slate with one hand and with
the other to grasp the Doctor’s left hand near the center
of the table. In such a position it was impossible for
the sitter to see the slate or the fingers of the medium.</p>

<p>On the forefinger of his right hand Slade had a
sort of thimble or ring to which was attached a bit of
slate pencil. With this he wrote a short message on the
bottom side of the slate, the scratching of the pencil being
quite audible to the sitter. When this scratching ceased
the Doctor would be seized with a series of nervous spasms
during which the slate was snatched from the sitter’s hand
for the fraction of a second and, unknown to him, turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
over, thus bringing the message to the top so that when
a few minutes later it was shown the message appeared
as though written between the slate and the table leaf.</p>

<p>A second method, which produced longer messages,
was the substitution of slates. If this message was of a
general character the slate was <em>switched</em> for one bearing
a previously written message concealed about a nearby
piece of furniture. If a special message was required it
was written by an assistant listening in the next room.
When the slate had been cleaned ready for the message
the Doctor gave the cue and the assistant rapped on the
door. The Doctor answered the knock in person, taking
the slate with him, and while listening to some commonplace
report the slates were exchanged. On resuming his
seat the slate was placed under the table leaf as before.
No sound of writing being heard, he would examine the
top of the slate several times but of course find no writing.
Finally, claiming that the influence did not seem powerful
enough, he would lay the slate on the top of the table,
message side down with a piece of pencil under it, and
then take both the hands of the sitter in his. Soon a
sound of writing would be heard and on examination the
message would be found. It was possible for Slade to
produce the sound of writing while his hands were holding
those of his client by slipping a piece of pencil
through threads on the side of his knee and rubbing it
against another piece held to the table leg by a wooden
clip.</p>

<p>One of the most common methods of slate writing is
known as the “flap slate.” The message is written beforehand
and concealed with a flap of silicated gauze, or
thin slate, which fits closely within the slate frame. One
side of this flap is covered with cloth to match that
used on the top of the table and when it is dropped is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
unnoticed. A better way is to cover the back of the flap
with newspaper and by dropping it on a newspaper it
becomes invisible.</p>

<p>There is an ingenious double form of this flap slate
with which it is possible to make a message appear on
both inside surfaces of a pair of locked slates without
having them leave the sight of the sitter for an instant.
The two slates are hinged together like the old-fashioned
school slates but with the hinges on the outside of the
slates. The slabs of slate are very thin and the ends of
the frames bevel toward them slightly. One end of each
frame is so made that by pressing on one of the hinge
screws the frame end is released and can be drawn out
about a quarter of an inch. A very thin slab of slate
called the “flap” is arranged to fit snugly over the real
slate when the frame ends are in place but drops out as
soon as they are released and drawn out. In working
these slates the medium writes a message on the inside
of one of them, say the left, and also on one side of the
flap. The end of the slate with the message is then drawn
out and the flap inserted, message side down, and the
frame fastened back in place. A secret mark on the outside
of the frame shows which slate is written upon. The
slates can then be shown and will appear clean on all
four sides, and it is possible to either seal or lock them
without interfering with the success of the demonstration.
They are then placed on the table with the fake ends
nearest the medium and while he leans on their ends with
half-folded arms, engaging the sitter in conversation, he at
the same time with the fingers of his concealed hand pulls
out the frame ends, allowing the flap to fall from one slate
to the other, and then secures it in place by putting the
ends back. Of course when the slates are opened a closely
written message is found on both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>Another sort of double slate intended for producing a
similar effect in dark seances or cabinet work also has a
loose end which instead of moving a quarter of an inch
draws out to any length, bringing the slab with it. After
the lights are out or the cabinet closed it is an easy matter
to draw out the slab and write a message on it.</p>

  <div class="caption">WRITING ON “HONEST SLATES” BY
MEANS OF WEDGE AND WIRE.</div></div>

<p>Writing is sometimes produced
between two perfectly
honest slates which have
been fastened together at the
corners by inserting a wedge
of hard wood between the
frames, thus separating them
enough to slip between them
a piece of wire with a bit of
slate pencil fastened to its
tip. By this means a message
can be produced at a
dark seance in a few minutes
without breaking the seals.</p>

<p>There is a form of slate
where the slab is invisibly
hinged on the side so that it
opens like a door and is held shut by a secret catch. This
slate can be used in a dark seance or under the table at a
light one. It can also be used on a cloth-top table with an
invisible trap. The trap and the hinged slate drop down
together and the medium is able to write on the slate by
reaching under the table.</p>

<p>Still another scheme used with a pair of hinged slates
is to have a hole through both frames at one end and
locking them with a padlock. In working this the pins
are pushed out of the hinges and the frames, moving
easily on the shackle of the padlock, permit the medium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
to write on the inside of the slates without difficulty, afterwards
fastening the slates together again by simply replacing
the pins in the hinges.</p>

<p>A method of concealing an extra slate is to have it a
trifle smaller than the rest and then hidden in some convenient
place, say the seat of a chair. A large slate is
first examined and laid on the chair. Later it is picked
up with the extra one under it. Sometimes the extra one
is hidden under the edge of a rug on the floor and worked
in the same way. At other times it is hidden on the
medium’s body and slipped under a large slate when the
medium stands with his right side on a line with the
sitter’s vision.</p>

<p>An entirely different method is employed to some
extent by mediums who are very rapid and interesting
talkers. Throughout the seance the medium walks
nervously about the room, keeping up a continual flow of
conversation. He passes two slates to the sitter for examination.
A third, the same size, with a previously written
message on one side, being concealed in a large pocket
inside the breast of his coat. While the slates are being
examined he walks about the room sometimes behind and
sometimes in front of the sitter, tapping him on the
shoulder to emphasize his remarks. As soon as the slates
are examined he takes them and, passing behind the sitter,
places them on his head and asks him to hold them there
and at the same time continuing his walk and talk. Of
course when the slates are examined there is a message
on the inside of one of them. When the medium steps
behind the sitter with the slates in his hand he quickly
changes the slate with a message which he has hidden for
one of the blank ones. This is no more bold or difficult
than many mediumistic tricks but it requires a particularly
fluent conversationalist to successfully produce the needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
amount of misdirection when the slates are switched.
Women mediums effect a similar exchange sometimes by
the aid of a special pocket in the dress.</p>

<p>A very effective method of getting a direct answer to
a question on the inside of a sealed double slate is as
follows. The slates are thoroughly cleansed by the sitter,
who writes a question on a slip of paper, folds it and
places it between the slates, with a bit of pencil. The
medium keeps at a distance during the writing and cannot
see what has been written. The slates are then sealed
with strips of paper and placed on the table and the
sitter holds both hands of the medium. After a time, as
no sound of writing is heard, the medium shows some
concern as to the possibility of failure and <em>suggests</em> that
the sitter hold the slates at the top of his own head. Still
there is no sound and the slates are returned to the table,
where they remain for some time without any sign of
writing. The medium becomes very much worried and
suggests that the slates be placed on the sitter’s head
again, remarking that if no sound is heard he will be
obliged to postpone that test till a future sitting. This
time the writing is heard almost as soon as the slates
touch the head and when it ceases and the slates are unsealed
a complete answer is found written on the inner
surface of one or both slates.</p>

<p>This seeming marvel is produced in the following simple
manner. The medium’s assistant steals into the room
with a duplicate pair of sealed slates and stands behind
the sitter. In the act of placing the slates on the head
a switch is made, and the sitter holds the duplicates while
the originals are taken into an adjoining room by the
assistant. He lifts the seals with a hot table knife and
after reading the question he writes an appropriate answer,
reseals the slates and returns to his position behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the sitter. Another exchange is made when the slates
are placed on the sitter’s head the second time. The
sound of writing is made by the medium under the table
with a piece of slate pencil and a bit of slate, but it is
so faint that the sitter cannot locate it.</p>

  <div class="caption">HOUDINI, MRS. HOUDINI, AND MR. TEALE DEMONSTRATING A METHOD OF SWITCHING
SLATES OVER A SITTER’S HEAD</div></div>

<p>In Bohemia, Province of Prague, I ran across a medium
who was especially good in slate writing. At first I could
not “get” his work. When I was playing in Berlin, at
the Wintergarten, he came in one night and wanted to
give a performance to the directors. I was guest but
went prepared for him. His work was so designed that
he walked behind us and in so doing he baffled me. I
asked for a private sitting and he readily consented.</p>

<p>When he did the slate writing at this sitting I felt
someone’s presence, and, sure enough, when he took the
slates away there was an almost imperceptible hesitation.
In this fraction of a second the slates were switched
through a <em>trap in the panel</em> behind me. I had a mirror
on a rubber elastic fastened to my vest and as I took my
seat I pulled the elastic so I could sit on it. I managed
to secure this mirror and keep it palmed in my hand, and
with it saw the panel slide open, the arm extended with
the duplicate slates, and the exchange made.</p>

<p>S. S. Baldwin, an acknowledged expert in Spiritualistic
and Telepathic tomfoolery, was bamboozled by a Dr. Fair,
according to his own story which he told to me in December,
1920. He received a message on a slate held by
himself under a table, and afterwards, at the suggestion
of the Doctor, made a thorough examination of the table,
the room, and everything in sight, but failed to discover
a concealed door in the wainscot of the wall through
which a man in black garments could find his way to space
under a sofa and thence to the table, which was a rather
large one, do the Spirit writing and then make his exit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
while Mr. Baldwin was fully occupied holding the slate
under the table with his eyes fixed on space above it.</p>

<p>One of the very best mediumistic tricks, and one that
has made the reputation of more than one well-known
medium, is done with a number of small slates and one
large one. The size of the slates is immaterial but the
large one should be three or four inches larger each way
than the others. The manner of presentation differs
somewhat with different performers but in general is as
follows.</p>

<p>When the sitters arrive the slates are piled near one
corner of the table, the larger one at the bottom and eight
or nine smaller ones on top of it. The medium stands
at the end of the table nearest the slates and after a few
casual remarks he picks up the top slate with his left
hand, changes it to his right and passes it to the sitter to
be examined and cleaned if desired. When he is quite
satisfied the medium takes it back, glances at both sides,
and then places it on the table directly in front of the
sitter. This is repeated with the remaining small slates,
which are not stacked up evenly but left in a haphazard
pile. While the last small slate is being placed on the
pile with the medium’s right hand he picks up the large
slate with his left and rests it on top of the others, at the
same time passing the sitter a pencil and asking him to
write a few lines on it requesting the Spirits to favor him
with a message and to sign his name to it. He is at
liberty to examine this slate also and to write his message
on either side.</p>

<p>The large slate is then placed at the right of the sitter
and he is asked to place his right hand on it. The small
slates are then evened up by the medium, secured by a
heavy rubber band and then placed in the center of the
table. The medium then takes a seat at the table opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the sitter and they clasp hands at the sides of the slates.
After a sufficient pause the slates are unbound by the
sitter and on a slate near the center of the stack a message
is found written in chalk or slate pencil and signed by
a departed friend.</p>

<p>The secret of this startling effect is extremely simple.
Concealed beneath the big slate at the beginning of the
seance is a smaller slate with the message already written
on it. This is picked up with the larger one when the
latter is placed on the stack for the sitter to write on it
and dropped on the others, written side down. The extra
slate is never noticed as the pile has not been counted
and the business of passing the slate pencil occupies the
sitter’s attention so that he does not realize that the large
slate rests on the small ones before he examines it.</p>

<p>The medium then takes about half the small slates, evens
them up and lays them to one side and repeats with the
remaining ones, laying them evenly on the others. This
is a perfectly natural move as the whole stack makes more
than a handful and by means of it the slate with the message
is placed in the middle of the stack. The stack is
then set on end, the rubber band placed around it, and it
is then ready to be placed in the middle of the table for
conclusion of the seance.</p>

<p>Two methods of writing between locked or sealed double
slates when only one or two words were needed puzzled
the investigators for a long time. The first was worked
with a strong magnet. The bit of slate pencil which was
put between the slates was specially prepared with either
powdered soapstone mixed with iron filings, water, and
glue, or a small piece of iron was used covered with a
paste of soapstone, water, and mucilage. By holding the
magnet under the slates and tracing the words <em>backwards</em>
the prepared pencils would follow the magnet and write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the words. The other method was worked with an electro
magnet set in the table, the necessary wires running down
one leg and making contact with a copper plate in the
floor under the rug by means of a sharp metal point on
the end of the leg.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of “raps”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> by the Fox Sisters
various methods have been devised for producing them.
One of the simplest expedients is for the medium to
slightly moisten the fingers and slide them very gently
on the top of the table. A little experimenting soon
shows the amount of pressure necessary to produce the
desired amount of sound and of course the medium is
cautious to let the fingers move only the desired distance
and that too when no one is looking.</p>

<p>Another simple method is to place the thumbs close
together in such a manner that the nail of one overlaps
the other a trifle. Then while the thumbs are pressed
hard on the table if one nail is slipped up or down distinct
raps are produced which seem to come from the top
of the table.</p>

<p>Some mediums produce raps by slipping a knee up and
down against a table leg. Others have been known to
fasten blocks of wood to the knee under the skirt and rap
on the table leg with a sidewise motion of the knee. Still
others strike the table leg with the heel of the shoe or
press the side of the heel against the table leg and by
moving the heel up and down the friction of the leather
against the wood produces raps.</p>

  <div class="captionl">

<p>TUBE AND PISTON ARRANGE&shy;MENT FOR
MAKING RAPS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Many mediums will not depend on these methods but
use more complicated ones which produce the raps by
means of mechanical devices which they conceal about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
their person. One of these consists of a small hollow
metal tube in which a long, heavy burlap needle is arranged
to move up and
down like a piston, and attached
to it to operate it a
stout black thread. The
tube is fastened to the inner
side of a trouser leg. The
free end of the thread is
brought out through a seam
and an inconspicuous little
hook attached. After being
seated at the seance table
the medium attaches the
little hook to the opposite
trouser leg and draws on it
until the needle point
comes through the cloth.
He then watches an opportunity to press on to the point of
the needle a cork to which has been attached a piece of lead.
This accomplished, all he
has to do is to place the knee
in the proper relation to the
table and by moving the
other back and forth the
piston is made to work up
and down, causing the
leaded cork to rap out all
sorts of messages.</p>

  <div class="caption">

<p>RAPPING MECHANISM IN HEEL OF
MEDIUM’S SHOE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another ingenious mechanical
contrivance is built
into the heel of the medium’s shoe and operated electrically
by running a wire from it up through the sole of the shoe
and passing it between the back of the shoe and the foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
and so on up the leg to batteries concealed in a pocket. By
placing this heel against a table leg the raps can be made
to sound as though coming from the middle of the table
and with a proper amount of “suggestion” the sitters can
be made to believe that the mysterious taps are produced
in turn under each pair of hands on the table.</p>

<p>Table levitating is easily accomplished in the dark,
through the aid of a confederate, by several different
methods. If the medium and his assistant are seated
opposite, by raising their knees at a signal they can lift
the table from the floor without difficulty. By slightly
rocking or tipping the table the medium and assistant
can simultaneously slip a foot under table legs diagonally
opposite, lift the table and keep it balanced by the pressure
of the hands on its top. These and many similar
methods are perfectly practical in dark seances but for
manifestations where there is any danger of the sitters
being able to see mechanical contrivances are resorted to.
The oldest form is simply a light, though powerfully
strong, length of blue steel riveted to a stout leather wrist
strap. When not in use the whole thing is concealed in
the medium’s sleeve. Sometimes both the medium and
the assistant are thus equipped.</p>

<p>This has been somewhat superseded by a chamois-covered
flat steel hook concealed under the vest and
riveted to a tight-fitting leather belt encircling the medium’s
body. With this hook under the table edge great
power can be exerted upon the table with very little
strain upon the operator. The lifting strength of a human
hair is not generally known, yet by means of one freshly
taken from the head, long enough to span a small light
table, the table can be lifted. One of the more modern
contrivances is a steel belt which the operator wears and
to the front of which is attached a short metal arm which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
can be engaged under the table top in such a way that
the operator can take his hands off the table and still
support it in the air. When releasing the table the metal
arm is slipped back and the steel belt shifted to another
position on the body, the medium’s coat concealing both.</p>

<p>Just as advances are made in other lines of work, so too
mediums advance in their methods of deceiving their
subjects. Few would resort to the old-time methods of
releasing a foot from under the foot of an investigator.
They have devised a new and baffling method. The
medium’s shoes are especially made for her in such a way
that by a certain pressure on the sole it is possible to
withdraw the greater portion of the shoe with the foot
from a false front. This front is made of metal and
padded. When the medium asks the committee to place
their feet on hers she makes sure that they do not over-reach
the portion she can withdraw from. In the full
glare of the light the investigator thinks he feels the
medium’s foot securely held under his own and as he
cannot see under the table the medium has the full use
of her foot to produce manifestations.</p>

<p>I once gave a seance while I was touring in England.
It was a dark seance and just at the psychological moment
a Spirit came through the window and walked around
on the wall and ceiling of the room and then out of
another window. The explanation is simple. On the bill
with me were two acrobats, hand to hand balancers. One
took off his shoes and stockings and the other sneaked up to
him. He pulled down the window and then did a hand-to-hand
balance with his partner and walked around the room.
He then went back to his seat, put on his shoes, and
looked as innocent and meek as possible under the circumstances
when the lights were turned on. I told every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
present that it was only a trick but as usual they insisted
that I was a medium.</p>

<p>A rope trick which always causes astonishment and
helps to create a belief in supernatural aid is done by
a woman medium who enters a cabinet with a rope bound
around her neck. The loose ends of the rope are forced
through opposite sides of the cabinet and held tightly
by two members of the committee. Nevertheless the
manifestations take place just the same and when the
cabinet is opened afterwards the medium is found bound
just as she was before the seance. As a matter of fact
when the curtains have been closed and the committee
have a grip on the ends of the rope the medium cuts the
specially tied loop around her neck. When she is ready
to come out she simply ties another loop, using a duplicate
piece of rope which she had concealed on her person.
When the committee release the ends of the rope she slips
the mutilated piece into her bloomers and appears with
the duplicate, which looks like the original one.</p>

<p>There are various methods of producing Spirit photographs.
One is to have a table prepared so that a developing
pan is placed where an X-ray penetrates to the
negative. This produces a “Spirit light.” Another is to
fix the side of the plate with some luminous substance,
shape, or flash, and it is astonishing what these things
look like. You get forms and frequently recognize faces
in the splotches. Father de Heredia has palmed a figure in
his hand and as the investigator signed the negative remarked:
“I might as well sign it myself.” In so doing
he rested the left hand over the plate while signing with
his right and the phosphorous figure in his hand was photographed
on the negative. A simple method is to have
something concealed in the hand and hold it over the lens
instead of a cap, and still another is to get the camera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
out of focus and snap it secretly, then when the regular
exposure is made there is an additional hazy something
on the plate.</p>

<p>One of the most startling swindles I ever heard of a
medium working was called “finger-printing a Spirit.” In
this test the medium shows the sitter finger prints of the
departed soul. I hesitated at first about including this
fake, fearing to add to the stock of unscrupulous mediums
but I finally concluded that the public should know about
it. The scheme was first discovered by a sculptor who
dabbled some in Spiritualism. One day, several years
ago, a workman fell from the top of the building, in which
this man had his studio, and was killed. The body was
carried into the studio and while alone with it the sculptor
conceived the idea of fooling some guests who were to
hold a seance that night. He hurriedly made a plaster
of Paris mould of the dead man’s fingers and later filled
it with a rubber-like substance used in his work. When
this had hardened and the plaster had been removed it
resembled, even to the most minute detail, the dead hand.</p>

<p>During the seance that night he produced finger prints
with it on a trumpet which he had lampblacked and upon
investigation it was found that these finger prints corresponded
exactly with those of the man in the morgue.
No one was able to explain the mystery and he kept the
secret for some time but later another medium learned
it and obtained a position in an undertaking establishment
where he found an opportunity after a while to
secure the finger prints of several of the dead who belonged
to the wealthy class. In due time he arranged
seances with the relatives and convinced them of his
genuineness. There are two cases on record where fortunes
were at stake because of this sort of fraud. In one
case five hundred thousand dollars changed hands upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the recognition of the finger prints of a man who had died
two years before. His hand had been maimed in an
accident and all the scars showed in the impression on the
Spirit slate. Fortunately a confession was wrung from
the medium and the money went to the rightful heirs.</p>

<p>A “manifestation” which seems mysterious but which is
in reality ridiculously simple is worked as follows. A
glass is filled with water and placed on the table in a
cabinet. Ribbons or bands of tape are then drawn over
it at right angles and the ends fastened to the table with
nails. Thus secured the glass cannot be lifted and the
top is entirely covered except some small openings. The
medium is then locked into the cabinet for a few minutes,
during which he keeps up a continual clapping of his
hands, but when the cabinet is unlocked the glass is
empty of water and the general impression is that the
Spirits drained it. As a matter of fact the medium had
worked his hands up near his face and shifted from slapping
his hands to slapping his face with one hand. This
left a hand free and with it he had no difficulty in producing
a straw from his pocket and sucking the water
from the glass.</p>

<p>Of course these examples are only a few of the many
means employed by mediums to produce their “manifestations”
and take advantage of the credulity of the
average sitter, but they are enough to show the reader the
sort of methods practiced and the lengths to which they
will go in their deceptions.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">With</span> what is perhaps pardonable pride we point to
the genius of American enterprise in scientific advancement
but it is with decided chagrin that I repeat that, as
modern Spiritualism was born in America, so also have
been most of the phenomena that under the mask of
Spiritualism have unbalanced so many fine intellects the
world over. Spirit photography, the most prominent of
mediumistic phenomena, had its beginning in Boston,
“Hub” of intellectual development, its coming being
announced by Dr. Gardner, a devout Spiritualist, who
discovered a photographer that “in taking a photograph
of himself, obtained on the same plate a likeness of a
cousin dead some twelve years before.”</p>

<p>This was in 1862, but a little more than a decade after
the original demonstration of so-called Spirit power at
Hydesville. Fortunately for the success of the new art
the photographer selected by the inhabitants of “Summerland”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
to use for the demonstration of the new phenomena
was a medium and of all the hosts in heaven the
spirit chosen to be photographed was (singular coincidence)
a cousin of his who had passed the border some
years previous.</p>

<p>No sooner had the discovery been announced than
spiritual enthusiasts in large numbers began flocking to
the studio of the medium, Mr. William H. Mumler, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
this kept up until evil spirits (?) began to create an atmosphere
of doubt and skepticism, whereupon he abruptly took
himself and his new enterprise to New York City, a precipitous
plunge presumably prompted by his Spiritual
guides.</p>

<p>The change proved to be of great financial benefit to
Mumler until the ire of the evil Spirits was once more
aroused and he was arrested on a charge of fraudulent
transactions. A most interesting and sensational trial
followed with many noted people appearing as witnesses,
among them being that prince of showmen, Phineas
Taylor Barnum, who testified for the prosecution, and
Judge John W. Edmonds, of the Supreme Court Bench,
for the defence.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>Mr. Barnum testified to having spent much time and
study in the detection of humbugs and had recently
written a book called “The Humbugs of the World.” He
knew Mumler only through reputation but had had some
correspondence with him in regard to his pictures, wishing
to learn his process and expose it in his book, and some
pictures which Mumler sent him Barnum paid ten dollars
apiece for and put in his museum labelled as “Spiritualistic
Humbugs.”</p>

<p>Barnum’s testimony was attacked by Mumler’s lawyer
who characterized it as being a “very pretty illustration
of humbug” and added that even if it were true Barnum
violated the “great precept relating to honor among
thieves,” but I want to go on record as believing that Mr.
Barnum told the truth in the Mumler case.</p>

<p>Judge Edmonds declared on the stand that he had seen
Spirits although many Spiritualists could not and recalled
an instance when he was on the bench trying a case in
which the payment of an accident insurance policy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the issue. He told the court that the whole aspect of the
case was changed after he saw the spirit of the suicide and
several questions which this Spirit had suggested were
put to the witness, the decision being reversed on the
testimony thus brought out. He also testified to his belief
that Mumler’s pictures were genuine photographs of
Spirits.</p>

<p>During the trial many methods<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> of producing Spirit
“extras” were shown in court by expert photographers
and the possibilities of the effect being produced by natural
means proven. The investigators, however, did not
have their case in good shape. There were strong grounds
for suspicion but they were unable to present positive
proof and though the court was morally convinced that
fraudulent methods had been practiced sufficient evidence
to convict Mumler was lacking.</p>

<p>Although acquitted, it is significant that Mumler refused
an offer of five hundred dollars to reproduce his
pictures in another studio under test conditions and while
free to resume his business so far as the court was concerned,
with a full harvest of dupes waiting to be fleeced,
he was nevertheless soon lost to view and seems to have
vanished entirely after the publication of his book in
1875.</p>

<p>Spiritualistic mediumship is not immune to the flattery
of imitation for even a casual examination of Spiritualistic
history and development shows that just as soon as a
medium forms a new alliance with the psychic power
dispenser and produces phenomena unknown before,
other mediums immediately begin to produce it also and
the new manifestation soon becomes epidemic. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
so with Spirit photography. No one had thought of such
a possibility before Mumler invented the mystery but
talented mediums everywhere when they heard of his
pictures began to produce them also. Stories of his
success crossed the sea and Europe discovered equal talent
there.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1874 a Parisian photographer by
the name of Buguet went over to London and attracted
considerable attention with his Spirit pictures. They
were of much higher artistic quality than any preceding
ones and Podmore in his “Modern Spiritualism” tells us
that:</p>

<p>“The Spirit faces were in most cases clearly defined,
and were, in fact, frequently recognized by the sitters,
and even W. H. Harrison failed to detect any trickery in
the operation.”</p>

<p>After a short stay during which his demonstrations
completely satisfied such men as Rev. Stainton Moses,
who was liberal with his endorsements, Buguet returned
to Paris, where the next year he was placed under arrest
“charged with the fraudulent manufacture of Spirit photographs.”
Unlike Mumler, his conscience did not prove
court-proof, or perhaps the evidence against him was such
that a friendly Spirit advised confession, at any rate he
told the court that all of his Spirit photographs were the
result of double exposure. On the strength of this confession
Buguet was convicted and sentenced to one year
of imprisonment and a fine of five hundred francs. A like
sentence was given to M. Leymaire, Editor of the <cite>Revue
Spirits</cite>, who admitted suggesting to Buguet that he should
enter the field of Spirit photography.</p>

<p>The police seized all the paraphernalia in the studio
of Buguet and took it to court. Amongst it was a lay
figure and a large stock of heads. These with dolls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
assistants at the studio took turns as inspirations for
Spirit extras. But the real interest of the trial was not
these revelations, Podmore tells us, for after all Buguet
did little to improve on the methods inaugurated by his
predecessors. It is the effect produced on his dupes by
Buguet’s confession, and the display of his trick apparatus,
which is really worthy of attention. Witness after
witness—journalist, photographic expert, musician, merchant,
man of letters, optician, ex-professor of history,
Colonel of Artillery, etc., etc.—came forward to testify
on behalf of the accused. Some had watched the process
throughout, and were satisfied that trickery had not been
practiced. Many had obtained on the plate unmistakable
portraits of those dear to them, and found it impossible
to relinquish their faith. One after another these witnesses
were confronted with Buguet, and heard him
explain how the trick had been done. One after another
they left the witness-box, protesting that they could not
doubt the evidence of their own eyes. Here, chosen
almost at random from many similar accounts, is the
testimony of M. Dessenon, picture-seller, aged fifty-five.
After describing how he had obtained in the first instance
various figures which he could not recognize, he
<span class="locked">continues:—</span></p>

<p>“‘The portrait of my wife, which I had especially
asked for, is so like her that when I showed it to one of
my relatives he exclaimed, “It’s my cousin!”’</p>

<p>“<i>The Court</i>: ‘Was that chance, Buguet?’</p>

<p>“<i>Buguet</i>: ‘Yes, pure chance. I had no photograph of
Mme. Dessenon.’</p>

<p>“<i>The Witness</i>: ‘My children, like myself, thought the
likeness perfect. When I showed them the picture they
cried, “It’s mama.” A very fortunate chance!... I am
convinced it was my wife.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>“<i>The Court</i>: ‘You see this doll and all the rest of the
things?’</p>

<p>“<i>The Witness</i>: ‘There is nothing there in the least
like the photograph which I obtained.’”</p>

<p>Incidentally there were two or three curious bits of
evidence on the value of recognition as a test. <em>A police
officer stated that Buguet showed him a portrait which
had done duty as the sister of one sitter, the mother of a
second, and the friend of a third.</em> Again, it came out in
the evidence that a very clearly defined head (reproduced
as an illustration to Stainton Moses’ articles in <cite>Human
Nature</cite>) which had been claimed by M. Leymaire as the
portrait of his almost life long friend, M. Poiret, was
recognized by another witness as an excellent likeness of
his father-in-law, <em>still living</em> at Breux, and much annoyed
at his premature introduction to the Spirit world.</p>

<p>From Mumler’s first pictures to the present day, Spirit
photography has played a large part in the field of Spiritualistic
devotion, and innumerable mediums have discovered
that they possessed the same phenomenal power
for producing the coveted likeness in the form of “extras”
on the sensitized plate. The art has now advanced to
such a stage that it is no longer necessary for one to sit
but all that is needed is a relic of the departed one, something
which either belonged or was of especial interest,
to the person. This relic is photographed and when the
plate is developed there appears beside it as an “extra”
the face of the departed; that is, I should say, if your
imagination is strong enough to see a resemblance to the
person supposed to be represented.</p>

<p>Nor is a camera necessary in these days, according to
Spiritualists. In fact, I am told that it is not necessary
to even open a box of plates, but that they can be “magnetized”
just as they come from the maker <em>provided</em> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
box is in the possession of the medium a few days in
advance of the sitting. This single condition fulfilled and
the demonstration will follow if the sitters, including the
nearest relative, pile their hands on top of the medium’s.
Then to create a solemn atmosphere the sitters are usually
asked to join in some form of religious devotion
such as singing “Nearer, My God, To Thee,” or a fervent
prayer.</p>

<p>This is the type of performance conducted by what is
known as the “Crewe Photographers” and supported and
defended by the present day leaders in Spiritualism. This
Crewe combination of photographers is under the management
of professional Spiritualists and is an organized
effort to promulgate this particular phase of Spiritualistic
phenomena. The group consists of Mr. William Hope
and Mrs. Buxton, Crewe; Mrs. Deane of London; and
Mr. Vearncombe of Bridgewater.</p>

<p>My friend, Harry Price, attended a sitting given by
Hope and tells of the religious exercises as follows:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Buxton sang several verses of ‘Nearer, My God,
to Thee,’ after which Mr. Hope made a long impromptu
prayer in which he thanked God for all our many mercies,
and hoped He would continue His blessings at the present
moment. He also craved blessings on our fellow creatures
and friends on the other side and asked assistance in
the attempt to link up with them, etc. Then Mrs. Buxton
sang another hymn, after which Mr. Hope picked up the
package of dry plates, put them between the hands of
Mrs. Buxton, placed her hands on his, and others in the
party piled their hands on top. Then we had another
impromptu prayer by Mrs. Buxton. Then the Lord’s
Prayer was sung, and a short hymn concluded the
service.”</p>

<p>Can one imagine a sacrilege more revolting than singing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
hymns, saying prayers, and calling on the Almighty
for help in such fraudulent work?</p>

<p>The combination evaded detection and were doing a
most successful business when in the spring of 1921, Mr.
Edward Bush, of the Society of Psychical Research, laid
a snare into which Hope walked with his eyes wide open.
Mr. Bush wrote for an appointment under the assumed
name of “D. Wood,” enclosing a photograph of a son-in-law
who was alive. On the back of the photograph was
written:</p>

<p>“Tell Dad, if anything happens to me, I will try and
let him have a Spirit Photo. Tell him to shout up to let
me know where he goes to.</p>

<p class="sigright">“Jack Ackroyd.”</p>

<p>Hope arranged a time for a sitting but returned the
photo, saying he regretted that it had been sent as it subjected
him to suspicion. When the time for the sitting
arrived Hope went under control and Mr. Bush manipulated
the plates as he directed but no “extras” appeared.
On the next day, however, when the plate was developed
after another sitting, there was an “extra” which proved
to be a likeness of the son-in-law. Mr. Bush published
the details of this exposure in a pamphlet and the London
<cite>Truth</cite> said editorially:</p>

<p>“But not only have William Hope and his sister
medium, Mrs. Buxton, cause to kick themselves at Mr.
Bush’s exposure, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Lady Glenconner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the Rev. Walter Wynn, and many other leading
lights of the movement have brought these products of
faith and hope forward as conclusive proof of the continuation
of existence and the possibility of communication
with the next world.”</p>

<p>Later in the same year, Mr. C. R. Mitchell, a former
leader of the Hackney Spiritualistic Society and well
known in mediumistic circles in London, was selected to
“undertake certain tests of a scientific nature for the purpose
of ascertaining the value of these Spirit phenomena.”
Mr. Mitchell was a photographer and wished to use his
own plates in the experiment but Mrs. Deane, who was
to conduct it, refused to let him unless he <em>first left them
with her for a few days to be magnetized</em>. He objected
to this and it was finally agreed that he could use his own
plates provided he would magnetize them himself but
the results were unsatisfactory. He then purchased from
Mrs. Deane a package of fresh plates, which, it was
claimed, had not been opened since it left the manufacturer.
The likeness of a soldier appeared on one of these
which Mr. Mitchell developed himself and he concluded
that not only had the plates been “magnetized” but that
they had been exposed in a camera as well.</p>

<p>The issue of <cite>Truth</cite> for June 28th, 1922, gives an
account of the experience of an ex-Indian missionary,
who, with three others, visited the Crewe photographers
and sat for Spirit pictures. Four exposures were made
and Spirit “extras” appeared on two of the plates but the
men could not remember whether the plates had at any
time been beyond their control so the missionary arranged
for another sitting taking the precaution to have his plates
marked on the corner with a glazier’s diamond. At this
second sitting one Spirit extra was produced but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
was <em>no diamond mark</em> on the plate, positive proof that an
exchange had been effected.</p>

<p>During 1922 the Occult Committee of the Magic
Circle took up the investigation of Spirit photography
first giving its attention to Mr. Vearncombe who produced
Spirit extras in connection with some object once in possession
of the deceased. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle put
this committee in touch with the Honorary Secretary of the
Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures, Mr. Barlow,
and at the latter’s suggestion sent him an unopened
package of plates for Mr. Vearncombe. Although Barlow
objected, “for Vearncombe’s satisfaction, though not
essential,” the package was enclosed in a lead case. Also
at Barlow’s suggestion a fee accompanied the package.
After a month of waiting the committee received a photograph
of the package and on the photograph was a spirit
message which read: “Barred your side.”</p>

<p>In order to remove the barrier a fresh package of plates
was forwarded to Vearncombe, this time in an ordinary
wrapper. Some months later, after the plates had been
Spiritually treated by Vearncombe, they were returned
to the committee. When developed “psychic extras”
were found on two plates. There was evidence that the
package had been tampered with and the same spirit had
been seen on other photographs.</p>

<p>The committee sent Vearncombe a package of plates
under an assumed name but received word from him that
it was not necessary to send plates. That small objects
which had belonged to the deceased would do and that
if the proper fee were enclosed photographic prints showing
the “psychic extras” obtained would be supplied. As
a full compliance with this suggestion would have been
useless as a test, a box of plates, a small object supposed
to have belonged to the deceased, and the fee were sent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>Again Vearncombe protested that he did not treat unopened
boxes of plates owing to many failures but offered
to expose plates on the object which had been supplied.
He was informed that such exposure would be unsatisfactory
whereupon rather than disappoint his correspondent,
he consented and forwarded the package with the statement
that he had treated the plates as desired and hoped
for success. On development a “psychic image” appeared
on one of the plates but the committee found that the
wrappers of the package had been unsealed and the plates
disturbed in their arrangement.</p>

<p>In order to clinch the results of their trapping Vearncombe
was informed that the experiment had been a “success”
but in order to “avoid criticism” he was asked for
an assurance that the package had not been tampered
with. It soon came in the form of a written statement
that the package had been treated by him and returned
to the sender as originally sealed when he received it.</p>

<p>The committee has arranged fourteen tests, twelve of
which had been violated, and as two or three violations
would have been sufficient evidence of fraud it did not
consider more necessary but reported that it had been
established by the evidence that fraud-proof packages
produced no results whereas it found “Spirit extras” in
packages which had been tampered with and that “collectively
the result is damning.”</p>

<p>The committee next directed its attention to Mrs. Deane
who, because of “complications from annoying sitters,”
had given up private practice at her residence and was
working under engagement with the British College of
Psychic Science. The Principal of the College, Mr.
McKenzie, had vouched for her as being absolutely conscientious
and straightforward in her work and one fully
qualified to produce “psychic extras without resort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
trickery.” Mr. Harry Price and Mr. Seymour negotiated
for a private sitting with her. She required that sealed
plates should be sent several days in advance for “magnetization.”
Six plates were exposed at the sitting and
on most of them “extras” appeared, but evidence was
obtained that the package had been opened previous to
the sitting and the plates <em>treated</em> but there had been no
substitution of plates.</p>

<p>An effort was made to get more convincing evidence
and after considerable difficulty a second sitting was arranged
for. This time the committee went to a manufacturer,
whose plates had been mentioned by the college
people as being preferable, and had a special package
made up and sealed. In this package each plate was so
marked that substitution or manipulation were sure to be
revealed. It was simply fraud-proof.</p>

<p>At the sitting the regular prayer and hymn singing were
conducted as usual after which the plates were exposed
and developed. It was found that the package had been
opened previously, the top plate removed and another
substituted for it and on this substituted plate, only, there
was a “Spirit extra.” At a third sitting a fresh box of
secretly marked plates were opened in the presence of
Mrs. Deane. Four plates were loaded into as many separate
slides and Mrs. Deane carried them into the adjoining
studio. On a table in the studio was a hand-bag
and beside it a hymn book. The hand in which she held
the four slides momentarily disappeared inside the bag
while at the same time she picked up the hymn book
with her other hand. With the hymn book she had picked
up a duplicate slide which, with a perfectly natural movement,
she added to the three in her other hand one of the
four marked plates having been dropped in the bag where
it was found later by one of the investigators who examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the bag while Mrs. Deane was absent for a moment.</p>

<p>Following the customary religious service the four plates
were exposed and then developed. Three plates which
had the identifying marks had no Spirit extra, but the
fourth plate which had no identification mark did have a
Spirit form.</p>

<p>As a result of this investigation the committee found
that whenever there was an opportunity packages were
opened and treated, plates substituted, and in the tests
which followed “Spirit extras” were secured, but when
the conditions were absolutely fraud-proof there were no
“extras,” and so far as it was able to discover all the
so-called Spirit photography rested on the flimsy foundation
of fraud.</p>

<p>In December 1921 I tried to visit Mr. Hope and have
some Spirit photographs made but I was informed that
his engagements would keep him busy for months and
that I would have to wait my turn. I then got in touch
with a friend of mine by the name of DeVega<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> who lives
in Glasgow and asked him if he would not see Hope and
arrange to sit for a photograph. After considerable correspondence
between DeVega and Hope the latter agreed
to make the photographs provided DeVega would go to
Crewe. DeVega assented to this, and an appointment
was made and the sitting took place. The following
account of DeVega’s experience is taken from a full
report which he sent me.</p>

<p>“Dec. 16, 1921.—Arrived at No. 144 Market Street,
the door was opened by an elderly lady. I asked if Mr.
Hope was in and presently he came down. I told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
that a well known member of the Spiritualist Society and
a man known to be a collector of Spirit photographs sent
me and that seemed to be sufficient for Mr. Hope.</p>

<p>“I had brought my own camera along and asked him
whether the pictures could be taken with it. However,
he said he used his own camera but would let me investigate
it all I wanted to. He told me he could
not possibly photograph me that forenoon as there
was another gentleman coming but arranged for two
o’clock.</p>

<p>“I watched Market Street, from a distance, all the forenoon
but saw no one go in. I arrived there promptly
but it was 2:30 before Mr. Hope arrived. A Mrs. Buxton
joined us. She, Hope and myself sat around a small
table. They sang hymns, said a prayer and asked the
table if all was favorable.</p>

<p>“At his request I placed my packages of plates on the
table. They placed their hands above them and sang
again. Hope suddenly gave a quiver and said, ‘Now we
will try.’ He showed me the dark room, which is a small
arrangement of about six feet high, three feet wide and
five feet long. There were two shelves and on these were
dusters, cloths, bottles of chemicals, a lamp, etc. The
lamp is an old affair lit by a candle. The room is so
very small that when two people are in it there is no
room to move about.</p>

<p>“He next showed me the camera and asked me to examine
it. I gave a glance at it and told him I did not
doubt his word, which seemed to please him a great deal.
I thought if it was a fake he would not allow me to examine
it as closely as he asked me to. It was an old make, one
fourth plate, studio camera and had no shutter, but worked
with a cap over a lens (the cap was missing). He next
showed me the dark slide. It was an old-fashioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
double wood end slide. I examined it very closely but
it was unprepared.</p>

<p>SO-CALLED “SPIRIT EXTRA” ON PHOTOGRAPH OF
HARRY PRICE MADE BY WILLIAM HOPE OF THE
CREWE CIRCLE</p>
</div></div>

<p>“The studio itself is a little glass hot-house arrangement
built on to the side of the house. A green curtain
is hung at the one end at which the sitter sits.</p>

<p>“We went again into the dark room to load the plates.
He gave me his slide and told me to leave two of my own
dark slides down in front of the light as he would try my
camera too. I opened my plates and placed two in his
dark slide and closed it. It was placed on the under shelf
where I could see it faintly. He then asked me to open
my own two slides slightly and sign my name on them.
(I signed J. B. Gilchrist.) As I signed them he moved
the lamp to let me see better. This threw the one fourth
plate in the shadow. After that he handed me the one
fourth plate slide to sign the two plates in the same way.</p>

<p>“<em>I am sure, although I did not actually see him, that
the slide I loaded, was changed for another one.</em> It was
too dark to see under the level of the shelf. I, for a moment,
considered letting my pencil slip and spoil the
plate and load in another from my packet but I thought
it advisable to let things go on as I would then see just
what his usual procedure was. I wondered at the time
<em>Why I could not have been told to take the plates from
the package, sign them and then place the plates in the
slide and place the slide in my pocket until they were to
be exposed. Why was it necessary to sign my own plates
in my dark slide at all? In fact, there was no necessity
for me to take my slide in the dark room.</em></p>

<p>“We went back into the studio, again I was asked to
examine the camera. However, I took up my position in
front of the camera. Mrs. Buxton stood at one side and
Mr. Hope at the other. The dark focusing cloth was low
over the lens (the cap being missing) and the slide open.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Mrs. Buxton and Hope sang a hymn and each took an
end of the cloth, uncovering the lens. This was repeated
with other plates as well.</p>

<p>“Now my camera was set up. I was asked to open the
slide and show them how the shutter worked. The exposure
was made. He placed his hand in front of
the camera, covering the lens and asked me to open the
slide myself as he did not want to touch it. <em>Now why did
he close the lens in that way?</em> It would have been simpler
to have pushed down the open front of the slide, closing
it, but I believe that on his hand was a spot of some
radiant salt or some such substance that would cause a
bright spot to appear on the negative, such as appeared
on that plate when it was developed. Holding his hand
in front of the lens while an exposure was being made is
such an unnatural action that I believe that was the cause
of what he called ‘a Spirit Light,’ when it was developed.
The next photograph I told him to press the release again
to close the shutter. He did so.</p>

<p>“We then adjourned into the dark room to develop the
plates. The two, one fourth plates were placed by me,
side by side, in a dish and the two three and a half by two
and a half in another dish and developed. By pouring the
developer from one dish to another, one of the one quarter
plates flashed up dark. I remarked that one was coming
up very quickly and he replied that ‘when they come
up like that it is a good sign for it is very likely
there is an “extra” on them.’ I said no more but in my
experience and knowledge of photography, such an occurrence
is impossible unless the plates have been previously
exposed.</p>

<p>“<em>The two plates were taken from the same packet,
loaded into the dark slide at the same time, with the same
dark room light and the same distance from the light.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
They were then exposed on the same subject immediately
after each other; the same length of exposure being
given (I counted them mentally) with the same aperture
of lens. The plates were then placed side by side in the
same dish of developer and I contend that the image must
come up at a uniform speed on both plates and that it is
impossible for one to flash up before the other and darken
all over unless it was previously exposed, especially
when there was no variation in the light when the exposure
was made, it being three P.M., December 16,
clear sky, no sunshine.</em></p>

<p>“An ‘extra’ did appear on this (one fourth plate). It
is a clean shaven face above mine and drapery hanging
from it. On my own three and a half by two and a half a
light splotch is over my face. Mrs. Buxton informed me
that it was a ‘Spirit light’ but Mr. Hope believed he saw
the faint features of a face in it.”</p>

<p>While in Denver, Colorado, in May, 1923, I called one
morning on Mr. Alexander Martin, whom Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle had told me was a noted psychic photographer
and a very wonderful man in his particular line.
Doyle himself had called on Martin the day before but
as Martin did not feel in the mood there had been no
demonstration. In this Sir Arthur was no more unfortunate
than Hyslop, the eminent Psychic investigator, who,
according to Sir Arthur, had made a special journey from
England to Denver in order to have a seance with Martin
but had not been successful.</p>

<p>Martin lived about fifteen minutes out of town by taxi.
I took with me my chief assistant, James Collins, so I
would have a witness if anything of a psychic nature occurred.
Collins had my camera as I wanted at least to
get a picture of Martin. We found him standing in the
doorway of a rear building and after I introduced myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
he seemed cordial. I showed him some Spirit photographs
which I had with me and after a few minutes talk I asked
him if he was willing that Collins should take a snap-shot
at us. He thought I was asking for a sitting and replied
that he did not feel good and besides had been engaged to
take the pictures of the children in two schools. I kept
on talking in my most entertaining manner and before
long he invited us into the house saying he would photograph
both of us. Meanwhile Collins had secured five
snap-shots at close range without Martin knowing it.</p>

<p>When we went into the house I walked right into the
dark room but Martin called me saying:</p>

<p>“Now don’t you go in there, just wait a minute.”</p>

<p>While we waited outside Martin spent about eight minutes
in the dark room. Then he came out and we went
into his studio, a simple room with a black background.
He had me sit down and placed Collins behind me on my
right. As a test I told Collins to step over to the other
side as it might look better. Then when he had done so
I turned to Martin and asked:</p>

<p>“Is that all right or is it better to have him take the
original position?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be nicer if he stood where he was in
the first place,” Martin replied.</p>

<p>This led me to think he was keeping that side of the
plate clean for something to appear. There was considerable
light in the room and Martin pulled a dark screen
on our right explaining that he did not need much light
for the psychic stuff, then putting a shade on his eyes
he turned to us and said:</p>

<p>“Now keep quiet and I will try and do something.”</p>

<p>When he uncovered the lens I counted the time of the
exposure which was about fifteen seconds. As he covered
it again he said to us:</p>

<div id="i_134" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23em;">
  <img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="1080" height="1564" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">HOUDINI AND ALEXANDER MARTIN</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>“That is all I can do to-day. Now I must hurry away.”</p>

<p>We thanked him and as we were going out I asked him
if he had any photographs we could see. He went into
an adjoining room but closed the door so we had no opportunity
to look in. When he came out he had four
photographs which he allowed me to keep but he would
not write on them who they were of.</p>

<p>The next day I went to see him again and he gave me
another seance. This time he said he would have to cut
a plate and he gave me a book to read while I waited. In
looking for a piece of paper on which to write my address
he picked up a lot of newspapers and I noticed some scientific
publications systematically inserted between the leaves
which led me to think he was trying to hide his knowledge
and wished to appear as a simple minded old man who
knew but little about photography.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest doubt that Mr. Martin’s Spirit
photographs were simply double exposures. I think his
method was to cut out various pictures, place them on a
background and make an exposure. His plates were then
ready for his next sitter, which in the above instance was
myself. Being an expert photographer he might have
used the original wet plate method of making an exposure,
developing it, washing the emulsion off the plate and refinishing
it with a new emulsion but I am convinced that
the two Spirit photos which he made of me were simply
double exposures.</p>

<p>The technique of photography does not trouble the
psychic operator. He has no regard for the laws of light
or chemistry. The fact that in all of his pictures the Spirits
appear to be perfectly conscious of posing does not disconcert
him, nor is he disturbed because they always
appear as they were in life. How much more interesting
it would be and how much more such photographs would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
add to our knowledge and aid the advancement of science
if once in a while the Spirits would permit themselves to
be snapped while engaged in some Spiritual occupation.</p>

<p>From a logical, rational point of view, Spirit photography
is a most barefaced imposition and stands as evidence
of the credulity of those who are in sympathy with
the superstitions of occultism. It is also evidence of how
unscrupulous mediums become and how calloused their
consciences.</p>

<p>In this country there is no such organized group of
Spirit photographers as the Crewe photographers in England.
Since Mumler’s narrow escape from deserved punishment
and his disappearance there have been few who
had the courage to operate as boldly as he did. The most
conspicuous one practicing at the present time is Dr. (?)
W. M. Keeler, who according to Spiritualistic publications
has a nerve and conscience equal to any psychic undertaking.</p>

<p>With Spirit photography as with all other so-called
psychic marvels, there never has been, nor is now, any
proof of genuineness beyond the claim made by the
medium. In each and every case it is a simple question
of veracity, and when the most sincere believers in Spiritualism
unhesitatingly admit, as they do, that all mediums
at times resort to fraud and lying, what dependence can
possibly be placed in any statement they make?</p>

<p>There can be no better evidence of rottenness in the
whole structure than the fact that for upwards of forty
years there have been standing offers of money in amounts
ranging from five hundred to five thousand dollars for a
single case of so-called phenomena which could be proven
actually psychic. Knowing the character of mediums
as I do I claim if proof were possible there is not a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
medium, including Spirit photographers, who would not
have jumped at the chance to win such a prize. If there
are any who are operating honestly let them come forward
with proof and take the reward.</p>

<span class="subhead">SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Spiritualism</span> has claimed among its followers numbers
of brilliant minds—scientists, philosophers, professionals
and authors. Whether these great minds have been misdirected,
whether they have followed the subject because
they were convinced fully of its truth, or whether they
have been successfully hoodwinked by some fraudulent
medium, are matters of conjecture and opinion; nevertheless
they have been the means of bringing into the ranks
of Spiritualism numbers of those who allow themselves
to be led by minds greater and more powerful than their
own.</p>

<p>Such a one is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. His name
comes automatically to the mind of the average human
being to-day at the mention of Spiritualism. No statistician
could fathom the influence he has exerted through
his lectures and his writings or number the endless chain
he guides into a belief in communication with the Realm
Beyond. His faith and belief and confidence in the movement
have been one of the greatest assets of present-day
believers and whatever one’s views on the subject, it is
impossible not to respect the belief of this great author
who has wholeheartedly and unflinchingly thrown his life
and soul into the conversion of unbelievers. Sir Arthur
<em>believes</em>. In his great mind there is <em>no</em> doubt.</p>

<p>He is a brilliant man, a deep thinker, well versed in
every respect, and comes of a gifted family. His grandfather,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
John Doyle, was born in Dublin in 1797. He
won popularity and fame in London with his caricatures
of prominent people. Many of his original drawings are
now preserved in the museum under the title “H. B.
Caricatures.” He died in 1868. An uncle of Sir Arthur’s
was the famous “Dicky Doyle,” the well-known cartoonist
of <i>Punch</i> and designer of the familiar cover of that
magazine. In his later years he became prominent as an
illustrator, making drawings for <i>The Newcomes</i> in
1853, and becoming especially successful in illustrating
such fairy stories as Hunt’s “Jar of Honey,” Ruskin’s
“King of the Golden River,” and Montelbas’ “Fairy
Tales of all Nations.” The fact that he leaned toward
Spiritualism is not generally known. Sir Arthur’s father,
Charles A. Doyle, was also an artist of great talent though
not in a commercial way. His home life is beautiful and
Lady Doyle has told me on numerous occasions that he
never loses his temper and that his nature is at all times
sunshiny and sweet. His children are one hundred per
cent children in every way and it is beautiful to note the
affection between the father, mother and the children.
He is a great reader who absorbs what he reads but he believes
what he sees in print <em>only</em> if it is favorable to
Spiritualism.</p>

<p>The friendship of Sir Arthur and myself dates back to
the time when I was playing the Brighton Hippodrome,
Brighton, England. We had been corresponding and had
discussed through the medium of the mail, questions regarding
Spiritualism. He invited Mrs. Houdini and myself
to the Doyle home in Crowborough, England, and in
that way an acquaintanceship was begun which has continued
ever since. Honest friendship is one of life’s most
precious treasures and I pride myself in thinking that we
have held that treasure sacred in every respect. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
all these years we have exchanged clippings which we
thought might be of mutual interest and on a number of
occasions have had an opportunity to discuss them in
person. Our degree of friendship may be judged best
from the following letter of Sir Arthur’s.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For goodness’ sake take care of those dangerous stunts
of yours. You have done enough of them. I speak because
I have just read of the death of the “Human Fly.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
Is it worth it?</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>It would be difficult to determine just when Sir Arthur
and I first discussed Spiritualism, but from that talk to
the present we have never agreed upon it. Our viewpoints
differ; we do not believe the same thing. I know that he
treats Spiritualism as a religion. He believes that it is
possible and that he can communicate with the dead.
According to his marvellous analytical brain he has had
proof positive of this. There is no doubt that Sir Arthur
is sincere in his belief and it is this sincerity which has
been one of the fundamentals of our friendship. I have
respected everything he has said and <em>I have always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
unbiased</em>, because at no time have I refused to follow the
subject with an open mind. I cannot say the same for
him for he has refused to discuss the matter in any other
voice except that of Spiritualism and in all our talks
quoted only those who favored it in every way, and if
one does not follow him sheep-like during his investigations
then he is blotted out forever so far as Sir Arthur
is concerned. Unfortunately he uses the reasoning, so
common among Spiritualists, that no matter how often
mediums are caught cheating he believes the only reason
for it is that they have overstepped their bounds and
resorted to trickery in an effort to convince. I wonder if
some day Sir Arthur will forget that he is a Spiritualist
and argue a case of trickery with the sound logic of an
outsider. I firmly believe that if he ever does he will see
and acknowledge some of his errors. I am ready to believe
in Sir Arthur’s teachings if he can convince me beyond the
shadow of a doubt that his demonstrations are genuine.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind, Sir Arthur believes implicitly
in the mediums with whom he has convened and
he knows positively, in his own mind, they are all genuine.
Even if they are caught cheating he always has some sort
of an alibi which excuses the medium and the deed. He
insists that the Fox Sisters were genuine, even though
both Margaret and Katie confessed to fraud and explained
how and why they became mediums and the methods
used by them to produce the raps.</p>

<p>“Like Cæsar’s wife—always above suspicion,” Hope
and Mrs. Dean pass in his category as genuine mediums.
He has often told me that Palladino<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and Home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
some day would be canonized for the great work they did in
the interest of Spiritualism, even though they were both
exposed time and time again. In all gravity he would
say to me, “Look what they did to Joan of Arc.” To Sir
Arthur it is a matter of most sacred moment. It is his
religion, and he would invariably tell me what a cool
observer he was and how hard it would be to fool him, or
in any way deceive him.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> He told me that he did not
believe any of “the nice old lady mediums” would do
anything wrong and it was just as unlikely for some old
gentleman, innocent as a child unborn, to resort to
trickery. But there comes to my mind the notorious Mrs.
Catherine Nicol and her two daughters who were continuously
getting in and out of the law’s net, usually
breaking the heads of a few detectives in the process.
Among the “nice old lady” mediums might be mentioned
a prominent medium of Boston who was accused of taking
unlawfully from one of her believers over eight thousand
dollars in cash.</p>

<p>Another case was that of a medium who received
$1,000 from a man in Baltimore for the privilege of a
few minutes’ chat with the Spirit of his dead wife. He
later sued her for fraud. Later she was exposed while
giving a seance in Paris, but after a few years she appeared
in New York City.</p>

<p>At this time Asst. District Attorney Krotel asked that
she be brought into court to answer to a charge of selling
California mining stock to her followers through the advice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
of certain disembodied Spirits. The stock was found to
be worthless.</p>

<p>There was also a woman, who was arrested and
convicted for vagrancy in Seattle and numerous other
cases, such as that of Katie King of Philadelphia in 1875;
however, no matter how many cases I cited, it did not seem
to make any impression on Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>I had known for some time that a number of people
wanted to draw Doyle into a controversy. When I saw
Sir Arthur I told him to be careful of his statements and
explained a number of pitfalls he could avoid. Nevertheless,
despite my warnings, he would say: “That’s all right,
Houdini, don’t worry about me, I am well able to take
care of myself. They cannot fool me.” To which I would
reply he had no idea of the subtleness of some of the
people who were trying to draw his fire.</p>

<p>When I called Sir Arthur’s attention to the number of
people who have gone crazy on the subject because of
persistent reading, continuous attendance at seances and
trying automatic writing, his answer would be: “People
have been going mad<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> for years, and you will find on
investigation that many go mad on other subjects besides
Spiritualism.” On being reminded that most of these
people hear voices and see visions, he denied that they
were hallucinations, and insisted that he had spoken
to different members of his family.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>I recall several flagrant instances in which Sir Arthur’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
faith has, I think, misguided him. One particular time
was when he attended a public seance by a lady known
as “The Medium in the Mask.” Among those present at
the time was Lady Glenconner, Sir Henry Lunn and Mr.
Sidney A. Mosley, a special representative of a newspaper.</p>

<p>According to reports, the medium wore a veil like a
“yashmak.” She appeared very nervous. A number of
articles, including a ring that had belonged to Sir Arthur’s
deceased son, were put in a box, and the medium correctly
gave the initials on the ring, although Sir Arthur said
that they could hardly be discerned, even in a good light,
they were so worn off.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>Later in describing another article, the medium said the
words, “Murphy” and “button” and it was afterwards
explained that “Murphy’s button” was a surgical operation
term. She said that the person described would die
as a result of the operation. Unfortunately, for the medium,
no one present knew of such a case and yet, <em>Sir
Arthur described this seance as very clever</em>.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The “Masked Lady” was sponsored by a theatrical
agent and illusionist and all proceedings of the seances
were brought to light in a suit against Mr. George Grossman
and Mr. Edward Laurillard, theatrical producers, to
recover damages for breach of agreement to place a West
End theatre at his disposal.</p>

<p>Accounts of mediums by the name of “Thompson”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
have misled several people. There is a Thompson of
New York and a Thomson of Chicago. Sir Arthur had a
seance with the Thompsons of New York and according
to all the news clippings I have had they claimed to have
brought back his mother. In fact it was stated that he
asked permission to kiss his mother’s hand.</p>

<p>The Thomsons got into trouble in Chicago and New
Orleans also.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> As a matter of fact I was in Chicago
when their trial took place. I had been present at two
of their seances. The first was in New York at the
Morosco Theatre and I had all I could do to keep J. F.
Rinns from breaking up the performance. The second
was in Chicago. It was a special seance given after my
performance at the Palace Theatre. I was accompanied by
H. H. Windsor, Publisher and Editor of <i>Popular Mechanics</i>;
Oliver R. Barrett, a prominent member of the
bar; Mr. Husband Manning, author; and Leonard Hicks,
a well-known hotel proprietor. Among others present at
the seance were Cyrus McCormick, Jr., Muriel McCormick,
and Mrs. McCormick McClintock. We witnessed
a number of unsatisfactory phenomena and afterwards
adjourned to the home of Cyrus McCormick and discussed
the seance, being unanimously of the opinion that it was a
glaring fraud just as I had believed the one in New York
to be.</p>

<p>At the Morosco Theatre, New York City, the Thomsons
made the broad statement that they had been tested by
Stead and Sir Oliver Lodge and at a special seance he had
come out and publicly endorsed Mrs. Thomson as being
genuine. The following letter not only disproves this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
but explains the feeling of an active Spiritualist toward
the Thomsons.</p>

“7th January 1921.
</p>

<p class="in0">“Dear Mr. <span class="locked">Houdini:—</span></p>

<p>“It is a pleasure to hear from you, and I thank you for
asking the question about the Thomsons. I have replied
to one or two other queries of the same kind, but I would
be grateful if you would make it known that any statement
that I have vouched for their genuineness, is absolutely
false.</p>

<p>“I only saw them once, at a time when they called
themselves Tomson. It was at Mr. Stead’s house, at his
urgent request. I considered the performance fraudulent,
but the proof was not absolutely complete because the
concluding search was not allowed, and the gathering
dispersed in disorder, or at least with some heat.</p>

<p>“I felt sorry at this termination, and it is just possible
that Thomson genuinely thought I was favourably impressed.
That is the charitable view to take, but it is not
the true view, and Mr. Stead was annoyed with me because
of my skeptical attitude. (He has since admitted to me,
from the other side, that he was wrong and I was right;
bringing the subject up spontaneously. This latter statement,
however, is not evidence.)</p>

<p>“What I should like the public to be assured of, is that
I was <em>not</em> favourably impressed, and never vouched for
them in any way.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must assume that Thomson is aware
of that, and therefore is not acting in good faith, because
once in England the same sort of statement was made,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
either at Leicester or at Nottingham I think, and I
wrote to a paper to contradict it.</p>

<p>“With all good wishes believe me,</p>

(Signed) <span class="insig">“<span class="smcap">Oliver Lodge</span>.”</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Arthur personally told me that he was convinced
of the genuineness of the Welsh miners of Cardiff, or
Thomas Brothers. Stuart Cumberland who was infinitely
my superior in investigation (he had a start of 20 years)
told me that there wasn’t a chance of the Thomas Brothers
being genuine, and related how, owing to the great interest
of Sir Arthur in them, the <i>London Daily Express</i> eventually
induced them to hold a seance before a committee
of investigators. Cumberland was to have been one of
the committee, but the mediums refused to allow him to
be “Among those present.” As they refused to proceed
if Cumberland was admitted, it was thought advisable to
eliminate him. Before leaving, Cumberland arranged the
musical instruments that were used and instructed the investigating
committee how to detect fraud. The feature
of the seance was the passing along in the circle, of a
button and a pair of suspenders, which were thrown on
the knees of a news Editor present. I ask the common-sense
reader what benefit this would be—to project a
button clear across the room and to find a pair of suspenders
on a sitter’s knee? If there is any object lesson in
this, please let me know!</p>

<p>At the seance, Lady Doyle was asked whether she was
cold, on answering in the affirmative a holland jacket
which had been worn by the medium was dropped in her
lap. The Thomas Brothers claimed this had been done by
the Spirits. When the seance was over, the medium was
found bound but minus his coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>When I quizzed Sir Arthur about the manner in which
the Thomas Brothers of Cardiff were bound during a
seance which he attended, he told me that they were secured
so tightly that it was impossible for them to move
as they were absolutely helpless. I told him that did not
make it genuine, for any number of mediums had been
tied the same way and had managed to free themselves.
He replied that I might be able to release myself by natural
means, but that mediums do not have to, as they
always receive Spiritual help. Maybe so, but I should
like, sometime, to tie them myself and see whether the
Spirits could release them under test conditions.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>I reminded Sir Arthur of the Davenport Brothers and
called to his attention the fact that they were able to
release themselves. Sir Arthur feels very strongly in
the matter of the Davenport Brothers and although I
have told him and proven to him that I was a pupil of
Ira Erastus Davenport<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> and that Ira personally told me
that they did not claim to be Spiritualists and their performances
were not given in the name of Spiritualism, Sir
Arthur insists that they <em>were</em> Spiritualists and has strongly
said that if they did their performances under any other
name, then Ira was “not only a liar, but a blasphemer as
he went around with Mr. Ferguson, a clergyman, and
mixed it all up with religion.”</p>

<p>I want to go on record that to the best of my knowledge
and belief I never stated that Sir Arthur endorsed the
mediumship of the New York Thompsons. I did say there
were full page articles<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> where he was illustrated as accepting
the genuineness of the materialization of his
mother. I never claimed that Sir Arthur’s son or brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
came through the Thomas mediums in Cardiff. I did
state that Sir Arthur said they were genuine and that they,
the mediums, were helpless to move because he had tied
them and in his judgment if they were tied in my presence
I would be convinced of their genuineness. I wish to call
attention to the fact that in a letter written by the late
Stuart Cumberland he agreed with me that there was not
a vestige of truth in the mediumship of the Thomas
Brothers, and regarding Sir Arthur’s endorsement of the
“Masked Lady,” I did not say he endorsed her although
I should judge from newspaper<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> accounts he seemed very
much impressed.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur has rarely given me an opportunity to deny
or affirm any statement. In fact one of our sore points
of discussion has been the matter of being quoted, or
misquoted,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> in newspapers or periodicals and it seems
that Sir Arthur always believes everything I have been
quoted as having said. When I was in Oakland, California,
I was interviewed by a Mr. Henderson of the <i>Oakland
Tribune</i>. I gave him some material to work on, enough
for one article from which, to my surprise, he wrote a
series of eight articles enlarging and misquoting to an
“nth” degree. Sir Arthur took exception to a number of
statements which I was supposed to have made and he
replied to them caustically through the press and then
sent me the following letter in explanation.</p>

<p>At the written invitation of Sir Arthur and Lady Doyle
Mrs. Houdini and I visited them while they were stopping
at the Ambassador Hotel in Atlantic City. One day as
Sir Arthur, Mrs. Houdini and I were sitting on the sand
skylarking with the children Sir Arthur excused himself
saying that he was going to have his usual afternoon nap.
He left us but returned in a short time and said “Houdini,
if agreeable, Lady Doyle will give you a special seance, as
she has a feeling that she might have a message come
through. At any rate, she is willing to try,” and turning
to Mrs. Houdini he said, “we would like to be alone. You
do not mind if we make the experiment without you.”
Smilingly, my good little wife said, “Certainly not, go
right ahead, Sir Arthur; I will leave Houdini in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
charge and I know that he will be willing to go to the
seance.” Doyle said, “You understand, Mrs. Houdini,
that this will be a test to see whether we can make any
Spirit come through for Houdini, and conditions may
prove better if no other force is present.”</p>

<p>Before leaving with Sir Arthur, Mrs. Houdini cued
me. We did a second sight or mental performance years
ago and still use a system or code whereby we can speak to
each other in the presence of others, even though to all
outward appearances we are merely talking, pointing or
doing the most innocent looking things, but which have
different meanings to us.</p>

<p>In that manner Mrs. Houdini told me that on the night
previous she had gone into detail with Lady Doyle about
the great love I bear for my Mother. She related to her
a number of instances, such as, my returning home from
long trips, sometimes as far away as Australia, and spending
months with my Mother and wearing only the clothes
that she had given me, because I thought it would please
her and give her some happiness. My wife also remarked
about my habit of laying my head on my Mother’s breast,
in order to hear her heart beat. Just little peculiarities
that mean so much to a mother and son when they love
one another as we did.</p>

<p>I walked with Sir Arthur to the Doyles’ suite. Sir
Arthur drew down the shades so as to exclude the bright
light. We three, Lady Doyle, Sir Arthur and I, sat
around the table on which were a number of pencils and a
writing pad, placing our hands on the surface of the table.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur started the seance with a devout prayer. I
had made up my mind that I would be as religious as it
was within my power to be and not at any time did I scoff
at the ceremony. I excluded all earthly thoughts and
gave my whole soul to the seance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>I was <em>willing</em> to believe, even <em>wanted</em> to believe. It was
weird to me and with a beating heart I waited, hoping that
I might feel once more the presence of my beloved Mother.
If there ever was a son who idolized and worshipped his
Mother, whose every thought was for her happiness and
comfort, that son was myself. My Mother meant my life,
her happiness was synonymous with my peace of mind.
For that reason, if no other, I wanted to give my very
deepest attention to what was going on. It meant to me
an easing of all pain that I had in my heart. I especially
wanted to speak to my Mother, because that day, <em>June 17</em>,
1922, was her birthday.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> I was determined to embrace
Spiritualism if there was any evidence strong enough to
down the doubts that have crowded my brain for the past
thirty years.</p>

<p>Presently, Lady Doyle was “seized by a Spirit.” Her
hands shook and beat the table, her voice trembled and
she called to the Spirits to give her a message. Sir
Arthur tried to quiet her, asked her to restrain herself,
but her hand thumped on the table, her whole body
shook and at last, making a cross at the head of the page,
started writing. And as she finished each page, Sir
Arthur tore the sheet off and handed it to me. I sat
serene through it all, hoping and wishing that I might
feel my mother’s presence. There wasn’t even a semblance
of it. Everyone who has ever had a worshipping
Mother and has lost earthly touch, knows the feeling
which will come over him at the thought of sensing her
presence.</p>

<p>The letter which follows, purported to have come from
my Mother, I cannot, as much as I desire, accept as having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
been written or inspired by the soul or Spirit of my
sweet Mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, thank God, thank God, at last I’m
through—I’ve tried, oh, so often—now I am happy.
Why, of course I want to talk to my boy—my own beloved
boy—Friends, thank you, with all my heart for <span class="locked">this.”—</span></p>

<p>“You have answered the cry of my heart—and of his—God
bless him—a thousandfold for all his life for me—never
had a Mother such a son—tell him not to grieve—soon
he’ll get all the evidence he is so anxious for—Yes
we know—tell him I want him to try and write in his
own home. It will be far better.”</p>

<p>“I will work with him—he is so, so dear to me—I am
preparing so sweet a home for him in which some day in
God’s good time he will come to it, is one of my great
joys preparing for our future.”</p>

<p>“I am so happy in this life—it is so full and joyous—my
only shadow has been that my beloved one hasn’t
known how often I have been with him all the while, all
the while—here away from my heart’s darling—combining
my work thus in this life of mine.”</p>

<p>“It is so different over here, so much larger and bigger
and more beautiful—so lofty—all sweetness around one—nothing
that hurts and we see our beloved ones on
earth—that is such a joy and comfort to us—Tell him I
love him more than ever—the years only increase it—and
his goodness fills my soul with gladness and thankfulness.
Oh, just this, it <em>is</em> me. I want him only to
know that—that—I have bridged the gulf—that is what
I wanted, oh, so much—Now I can rest in peace—how
<span class="locked">soon—”</span></p>

<p>“I <em>always</em> read my beloved son’s mind—his dear mind—there
is so much I want to say to him—but—I am
almost overwhelmed by this joy of talking to him once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
more—it is almost too much to get through—the joy of
it—thank you, thank you, friend, with all my heart for
what you have done for me this day—God bless you, too,
Sir Arthur, for what you are doing for us—for us, over
here—who so need to get in touch with our beloved ones
on the earth <span class="locked">plane—”</span></p>

<p>“If only the world knew this great truth—how different
life would be for men and women—Go on let nothing stop
you—great will be your reward hereafter—Good-by—I
brought you, Sir Arthur, and my son together—I felt you
were the only man who might help us to pierce this veil—and
I was right—Bless him, bless him, bless him, I say,
from the depths of my soul—he fills my heart and later
we shall be together—Oh so happy—a happiness awaits
him that he has never dreamed of—tell him I am with
him—just tell him that I’ll soon make him know how
close I am all the while—his eyes will soon be opened—Good-by
again—God’s blessing on you all.”</p>

<p>In the case of my seance, Sir Arthur believed that due
to the great excitement it was a direct connection.</p>

<p>The more so do I hesitate to believe and accept the
above letter because, although my sainted mother had
been in America for almost fifty years, she could not
speak, read nor write English but Spiritualists claim that
when a medium is possessed by a Spirit who does not
speak the language, she automatically writes, speaks or
sings in the language of the deceased; however, Sir Arthur
has told me that a Spirit becomes more educated the
longer it is departed and that my blessed Mother had been
able to master the English language in Heaven.</p>

<p>After the purported letter from my Mother had been
written and I had read it over very carefully, Sir Arthur
advised me to follow out the advice, given by my Mother,—to
try to write when I reached home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>I picked up a pencil in a haphazard manner and said,
“Is there any particular way in which I must hold this
pencil when I want to write, or does it write automatically?”
<em>I then wrote the name of “Powell” entirely
of my own volition.</em> Sir Arthur jumped up excitedly and
read what I had just written. He saw the word “Powell”
and said, “The Spirits have directed you in writing the
name of my dear fighting partner in Spiritualism, Dr.
Ellis Powell, who has just died in England. I am the
person he is most likely to signal to, and here is his name
coming through your hands. Truly Saul is among the
Prophets.”</p>

<p>I must emphatically state that this name was written
entirely of my own volition and in full consciousness.
I had in my mind, my friend Frederick Eugene Powell, the
American Magician, with whom at the time I was having a
great deal of correspondence regarding a business proposition
which has since been consummated. There is not
the slightest doubt of it having been more than a deliberate
mystification on my part, or let us say a kindlier word
regarding my thoughts and call it “coincidence.”</p>

<p>A few days later Sir Arthur sent me the following letter
in reference to my explanation of the writing of the name,
“Powell.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">
“The Ambassador,<br />

<p class="in0">“My dear <span class="locked">Houdini:—</span></p>

<p>“... No, the Powell explanation, won’t do. Not
only is he the one man who would wish to get me, but in
the evening, Mrs. M., the lady medium, got, “there is a
man here. He wants to say that he is sorry he had to
speak so abruptly this afternoon.” The message was then
broken by your Mother’s renewed message and so we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
no name. But it confirms me in the belief that it was
Powell. However, you will no doubt test your powers
further.</p>

<p>I had written an article for the <i>New York Sun</i>, October
30, 1922, which gave my views in reference to Spiritualism
and at the same time answered the challenge offered by
the General Assembly of Spiritualists of New York State.
This had been called to the attention of Sir Arthur, who
wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
“Windlesham,<br />
Crowborough,<br />
Sussex.</p>

<p class="sigright">November 19, 1922.</p>

<p class="in0">“My dear <span class="locked">Houdini:—</span></p>

<p>“They sent me the <i>New York Sun</i> with your article and
no doubt wanted me to answer it, but I have no fancy for
sparring with a friend in public, so I took no notice.</p>

<p>“But none the less, I felt rather sore about it. You
have all the right in the world to hold your own opinion,
but when you say that you have had no evidence of survival,
you say what I cannot reconcile with what I saw
with my own eyes. I know, by many examples, the purity
of my wife’s mediumship, and I saw what you got and
what the effect was upon you at the time. You know
also you yourself at once wrote down, with your own
hand, the name of Powell, the one man who might be
expected to communicate with me. Unless you were joking
when you said that you did not know of this Powell’s
death, then surely that was evidential, since the idea that
out of all your friends you had chanced to write the name
of one who exactly corresponded, would surely be too
wonderful a coincidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>“However, I don’t propose to discuss this subject any
more with you, for I consider that you have had your
proofs and that the responsibility of accepting or rejecting
is with you. As it <em>is</em> a very real lasting responsibility.
However, I have it at last, for I have done my best to
give you the truth. I will, however, send you my little
book, on the fraud perpetrated upon Hope, but that will
be my last word on the subject. Meanwhile, there are
lots of other subjects on which we can all meet in friendly
converse.</p>

it is not with me, because you, having been truthful and
manly all your life, naturally must admire the same traits
in other human beings.</p>

<p>“I know you are honorable and sincere and think I owe
you an explanation regarding the letter I received through
the hands of Lady Doyle.</p>

<p>“I was heartily in accord and sympathy at that seance
but the letter was written entirely in English and my
sainted Mother could not read, write or speak the English
language. I did not care to discuss it at the time because
of my emotion in trying to sense the presence of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Mother, if there was such a thing possible, to keep me
quiet until time passed, and I could give it the proper
deduction.</p>

<p>“Regarding my having written the name ‘Powell.’
Frederick Eugene Powell is a very dear friend of mine.
He had just passed through two serious operations.
Furthermore Mrs. Powell had a paralytic stroke at that
time. I was having some business dealings with him
which entailed a great deal of correspondence; therefore,
naturally, his name was uppermost in my mind and I
cannot make myself believe that my hand was guided by
your friend. It was just a coincidence.</p>

<p>“I trust my clearing up of the seance, from my point
of view is satisfactory, and that you do not harbor any ill
feelings, because I hold both Lady Doyle and yourself in
the highest esteem. I know you treat this as a religion
but personally I cannot do so, for up to the present time
I have never seen or heard anything that could convert
me.</p>

<p>On May 21, 22 and 24 the <i>Scientific American</i> held
their first test seances. The permanent sitters were Mr.
Walker, Mr. Lescurboura, Mr. J. Malcolm Bird of the
Editorial staff of the <i>Scientific American</i>, Mr. Owen of
the <i>Times</i>, Mr. Granville Lehrmann of the American
Telephone and Telegraph and Richard I. Worrell, <em>a friend</em>
of the medium. Drs. Carrington and Prince of the Committee
of Judges sat on Monday. Dr. Prince and myself
on Thursday. On Tuesday the Committee was represented
by Mr. Frederick Keating, conjuror.</p>

<p>The medium, a man by the name of George Valentine
of Wilkes-Barre, Penn., claimed to be genuine. He was
trapped by being seated on a chair which was so arranged
that when he arose an electric light arrangement was fixed
in the room adjoining, together with dictographs and a
phosphorous button. In the estimation of the Committee,
Mr. Valentine was just a common, ordinary trickster.</p>

<p>Lady Doyle, Miss Juliet Karcher, Mrs. Houdini, Sir
Arthur and I were lunching at the Royal Automobile
Club in London, May 11, 1920, and Sir Arthur called
attention to the fact that a few days previously they had
been sitting at the same table with a powerful medium,
and he told me in a very serious tone, which was corroborated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
by Lady Doyle, that the table started to move all
around the place to the astonishment of the waiter, who
was not aware of the close proximity of the medium.</p>

<p>All the time he was relating it, I watched him closely
and saw that both he and Lady Doyle were most sincere
and believed what they had told me to be an actual fact.</p>

<p>There are times when I almost doubt the sincerity of
some of Sir Arthur’s <em>statements</em>, even though I do not
doubt the sincerity of his belief.</p>

<p>I have been over a number of letters which I have
received from Sir Arthur during the last few years and
selected the following excerpts which show his viewpoint
regarding many of the matters we have discussed.</p>

<p>“I do not wonder that they put you down as an occult.
As I read the accounts I do not see how you do it. You
must be a brave man as well as exceptionally dexterous.”</p>

<p>“How you get out of the diving suits beats me, but the
whole thing beats me completely.”</p>

<p>“I spoke of the Davenport Brothers. Your word on
the matter knowing, as you do both the man and the
possibilities of his art, would be final.”</p>

<p>“You are to me a perpetual mystery. No doubt you
are to everyone.”</p>

<p>“In a fair light I saw my dead Mother as clearly as I
ever saw her in life. I am a cool observer and I do not
make mistakes. It was wonderful—but it taught me
nothing I did not know before.”</p>

<p>“Our best remembrances to your wife and yourself.
For God’s sake be careful in those fearsome feats of yours.
You ought to be able to retire now.”</p>

<p>“These clairvoyants whose names I have given you are
passive agents in themselves and powerless. If left to
themselves they guess and muddle—as they sometimes do,
when the true connection is formed, all is clear. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
connection depends on the forces beyond, which are repelled
by frivolity or curiosity but act under the impulse
of sympathy.”</p>

<p>“I see that you know a great deal about the negative
side of Spiritualism.”</p>

<p>“If you think of a lost friend before going to a seance
and breathe a prayer that you may be allowed to get in
touch you will have a chance—otherwise none. It really
does depend upon psychic or mental vibrations and harmonies.”</p>

<p>“I fear there is much fraud among American mediums
where Spiritualism seems to have deservedly fallen into
disrepute. Even when genuine it is used for stock exchange,
and other base worldly purposes. No wonder it
has sunk low in the very land that was honored by the
first Spiritual manifestations of the series.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have very wonderful powers, whether
inborn or acquired.”</p>

<p>“I envy you the privilege of having met Ira Davenport.”</p>

<p>“Most of our great mediums at present are unpaid
amateurs, inaccessible to any but Spiritualists.”</p>

<p>“Something <em>must</em> come your way if you really persevere
and get it out of your mind that you should follow it as a
terrier follows a rat.”</p>

<p>“Mental harmony does not in the least abrogate common
sense.”</p>

<p>“I heard of your remarkable feat in Bristol. My dear
chap, why do you go around the world seeking a demonstration
of the occult when you are giving one all the
time?”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> Hope to be a true psychic and will give you
my reasons when I treat it, but you can give no man
a blank check for honesty on every particular occasion,
whether there is a temptation to hedge when psychic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
power runs low is a question to be considered. I am for
an uncompromising honesty—but also for thorough examination
based on true knowledge.”</p>

<p>“I am amused by your investigation with the Society
for Psychical Research. Have they never thought of investigating
you?”</p>

<p>“It was good of you to give those poor invalids a show
and you will find yourself in the third sphere alright with
your dear wife, world without end, whatever you may
believe.”</p>

<p>“Incredulity seems to me to be a sort of insanity under
the circumstances.” This was in reference to some photographs
of ectoplasm which I questioned.</p>

<p>“This talk of ‘fake’ is in most cases nonsense and
shows our own imperfect knowledge of conditions and
of the ways of Controls, who often take short cuts to their
ends, having no regard at all to our critical idea.”</p>

<p>“Our opponents talk of one failure and omit a great
series of successes. However, truth wins and there is lots
of time.”</p>

<p>“I never let a pressman (newspaper man) get away
with it with impunity if I can help it.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>“Our relations are certainly curious and likely to become
more so, for as long as you attack what <em>I know</em> from
experience to be true I have no alternative but to attack
you in turn. How long a private friendship can survive
such an ordeal I do not know, but at least I did not create
the situation.”</p>

<p>“You have a reputation among Spiritualists of being a
bitterly prejudiced enemy who would make trouble if it
were possible—I know this is not so.”</p>

<p>On page 150 of Sir Arthur’s book “Our American
Adventure” he says:</p>

<p>“Houdini is not one of those shallow men who imagine
they can explain away Spiritual phenomena as parlor
tricks, but he retains an open—and ever, I think, a more
receptive—mind toward mysteries which are beyond his
art. He understands, I hope, that to get truth in the
matter you have not to sit as a Sanhedrim of Judgement,
like the Circle of Conjurors in London, since Spiritual
truth does not come as a culprit to a bar, but you must
submit in a humble spirit to psychic conditions and so go
forth, making most progress when on your knees.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur has told me time and time again that his
whole life is based upon the subject of Spiritualism and
that he has sacrificed some of the best years of his life
to the betterment and spread of the cause, which, due to
his sincerity, is a beautiful faith.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> But in my opinion it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
is no “sacrifice” to convince people who have recently
suffered a bereavement of the possibility and reality of
communicating with their dear ones. To me the poor
suffering followers eagerly searching for relief from the
heart-pain that follows the passing on of a dear one are
the “sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur thinks that I have great mediumistic powers
and that some of my feats are done with the aid of spirits.
Everything I do is accomplished by material means, humanly
possible, no matter how baffling it is to the layman.
He says that I do not enter a seance in the right frame of
mind, that I should be more submissive, but in all the
seances I have attended I have never had a feeling of
antagonism. I have no desire to discredit Spiritualism;
I have no warfare with Sir Arthur; I have no fight with
the Spiritists; but I do believe it is my duty, for the betterment
of humanity, to place frankly before the public
the results of my long investigation of Spiritualism. I am
willing to be convinced; my mind is open, but the proof
must be such as to leave no vestige of doubt that what is
claimed to be done is accomplished only through or by
supernatural power. So far I have never on any occasion,
in all the seances I have attended, seen anything which
would lead me to credit a mediumistic performance with
supernatural aid, nor have I ever seen anything which
has convinced me that it is possible to communicate with
those who have passed out of this life. Therefore I do
not agree with Sir Arthur.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Years</span> have passed since my first meeting with the
Hon. Everard Feilding! Many times during those years
I have discussed Spiritualism with him and no one has
ever been more interested than he in the results of my
investigations and study of it and it was through his help
that I was able to investigate personally the famous Eva
Carriere, better known perhaps as Mlle. Eva.</p>

<p>One evening in the spring of 1920 during a quiet
dinner at his home in London the conversation drifted
toward Ectoplasm. I told Mr. and Mrs.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Feilding about
attending a Sunday meeting of the London Psychical
College through the courtesy of Hewat McKenzie. At
this meeting Mme. Bisson and Mlle. Eva were introduced
by Fornieur d’Albe and Mme. Bisson while delivering
an impromptu talk seized the opportunity to resent the
attack of a French magician and to explain in unmistakable
tones her antagonism toward prestidigitators.</p>

<p>Mr. Feilding assured me I was correct about her antipathy
towards magicians and suggested that the only
way I could ever hope to attend one of her seances was
to convince the medium that I was not one of the biased
prestidigitator class, and proposed as a means to attain
this end a theatre party to see my performance and thus
enable Mme. Bisson and Mlle. Eva to judge for themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
This was arranged and the night they came to
the theatre to see me I did the Torture Cell Mystery, in
which I am completely submerged, head foremost, in a
tank of water, and it is a physical impossibility to obtain
air while locked in the device. They were so much mystified
that they expressed a desire to attend another performance
of mine sometime in the near future. I had
just accepted a challenge to escape from a packing case
which was to be built on the stage by experienced carpenters
and thinking that it would be an interesting performance
for Mme. Bisson to witness I extended her an
invitation and received the following letter in reply.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">“May 19, 1920.</p>

<p class="in0">“Dear Mr. Houdini:</p>

<p>“We, Mlle. Eva and I, shall be charmed to see you at
the performance of which you have spoken to me, on next
Wednesday. Since you have had the great kindness to
offer us several tickets, it gives me great pleasure to
accept, and if you wish, you may send us four, as we
expect to join in the applause with Mr. and Mrs. Feilding.</p>

<p>“I also wish to tell you something else!</p>

<p>“You know that we give seances here, showing the
phenomena of materialization. These are not spirit
studies. They are scientific.</p>

<p>“It would interest Mr. Feilding and ourselves to have
at our seances a master in the art of prestidigitation, but
I have always refused to admit to my house, an ordinary
prestidigitator, or even one of better rank. Our work is
serious and real, and the gift of Mlle. Eva might disappear
forever, if some awkward individual insists on thinking
there is fraud involved, instead of real and interesting
facts, which especially interest the scientific.</p>

<p>“For you this does not hold! You are above all this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
You are a magnificent actor, who can not call himself a
prestidigitator, a title beneath a man of your talent.</p>

<p>“I shall therefore, (rather we shall) be proud to see
you attend our seances and hear you tell us all, after you
have been thoroughly convinced yourself, that their merit
is far beneath your own, for these manifestations depend
merely upon allowing the forces of nature to act, and lie
simply in truth of fact. Whereas with you, it is your
merit, your talent, and your personal valor that have
enabled you to attain the place of King in your art.</p>

<p>When I showed this letter to Mr. Feilding he was both
surprised and pleased for it gave him an opportunity to
invite me to become one of the Committee which was to
investigate Mme. Bisson and Mlle. Eva’s seances to be
held by the Society for Psychical Research, and so at the
combined invitations of the mediums and Mr. Feilding
I attended eight. Each of them lasted three hours and I
firmly believe that a description of them and their results
is important.</p>

<p>At these seances my word was pledged to give full and
sacred thoughts and I tried to control my thoughts so that
my whole attention could be given to the medium. There
was no scoffing and there was the will to believe. I felt
that if anything was manifested by the Spirits my conscience
would be clear. However, I sat with my eyes
open, taking in even the most minute details and keeping
on my guard against any trickery. A number of times I
occupied a “control” chair at the medium’s left with her
left limb between mine and both of my hands holding her
left hand and wrist, while Eric Dingwall had the Committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
seat on her right. Eva was accompanied at all of
the seances by Mme. Bisson and the method of procedure
was always the same. After Eva had been stripped and
searched<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> in an adjoining room by the lady members of
the Committee, she returned dressed in tights and
Mme. Bisson would then put her into a mesmeric sleep.
There is no doubt in my mind that the girl was really put
to sleep. We were requested to all join in asking her in
unison for about fifteen minutes at each crisis to “give”—“donnez”—then,
after about three hours, she would bring
forth this alleged ectoplasm.</p>

<p>At one of the seances the Hon. Feilding did insist on
Eva’s eating crackers and drinking coffee, so that if she
had anything concealed in her stomach, which she might
by regurgitation expel, the coffee would discolor it.</p>

<p>The seance of June 22, 1920, was held at 20 Hanover
Square, London. Mme. Bisson and Eva retired to another
room and Eric Dingwall sewed a black lace veil to the
tights which Eva wore. This veil completely enshrouded
her and looked like a sort of bag or net. The object of
this was to prevent her from placing anything in her
mouth or get anything from her tights to the neck—in
fact, it was a double security against fraud. We sat and
waited and finally she expelled from her mouth a great
deal of foam.</p>

<p>Feilding and Baggley stated that it looked as though
it had come from her nose. I saw distinctly that it was
a heavy froth and was adhering to her veil on the inside.
Dingwall, who sat next to the medium, agreed with me
it had emanated from her mouth, but when she leaned
forward it looked as though it was coming from her nose.
She produced a white plaster and eventually managed to
juggle it over her eye. There was a face in it which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
looked to me like a colored cartoon and seemed to have
been unrolled.</p>

<p>The last thing she produced that evening was a substance
which she said she felt in her mouth and asked
permission to use her hands to show. This was granted
and she took a load from her mouth behind the veil which
was wet and looked soaked. It appeared to be inflated rubber.
No one saw a face painted on it. Presently it seemed
to disappear. They all said it “vanished suddenly,” but
my years of experience in presenting the Hindoo needle
trick<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> convinced me that she “sleight-of-handed” it into
her mouth while pretending to have it between her fingers.
I know positively that the move she made is almost
identical with the manner in which I manipulate my
experiment. Dingwall was very confident and told Mme.
Bisson that he was <em>nearly</em> satisfied with Eva’s experiments.
She showed her peevishness to Feilding so plainly that I
could scarcely conceal my smiles.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation after the seance, Mme.
Bisson told the Committee that at one time Eva had
materialized on the top of her knees the head of an
American soldier with a heavy mustache and blue eyes.
It caused some merriment when Dingwall asked her how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>she could tell the color of a man’s eyes in the dark.
Mme. Bisson, perplexed and in grieved tones, asked
whether they were suspicious or simply did not believe
her. They tried hard to pacify her but to no avail.</p>

  <div class="caption">MME. BISSON, MRS. FEILDING (TOMCHICK), AND MLLE. EVA</div></div>

<p>At the seance of June 24th, held in the same place, I
arrived somewhat late but the Committee allowed me to
come in. That evening I felt that there was something
wrong in the air and after the lapse of two hours Mme.
Bisson told us that she was in grief and greatly disheartened
because there was so much suspicion aimed at her.
She was especially peeved at Dingwall, who had told her
that he was only “almost” convinced. At no time was
I antagonistic but, on the contrary, willing to help along.</p>

<p>Presently Feilding in a rather jovial mood left the room
for a breath of fresh air. When he came back he was
very serious and asked that they continue. Mme. Bisson
thought he was trying to tease her and became very angry.
She was wrong, in my opinion, but they argued and
expostulated for half an hour and then the seance broke
up. During the argument Eva, who was in a cabinet in a
“trance state,” spoke out as though she had not been in
a trance. I afterwards asked Mr. Feilding if this was
not suspicious, but he told me that it was possible for a
human being while in a trance or hypnotic state to carry
on a conversation consciously. When Mme. Bisson left
us Mr. Feilding told me that he was very sorry about
the unpleasantness and would make all possible amends
to her.</p>

<p>After a number of sittings with Eva during which
nothing startling occurred I made up my mind to be
lenient with the medium and help her, so I held her hands
for some time and gradually withdrew both of mine,
giving her all the leeway she needed in case there was any
desire on her part to use the hand which I was supposed
to be holding, but she made no move whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>I was not in any way convinced by the demonstrations
witnessed. I believe that Eva’s feats are accomplished by
regurgitation. If not, the work she is reputed to do is
an “inside job.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> I regret that I do not believe Mme.
Bisson entitled to a clean bill of health. During the
seances which I attended she kept up a quasi hypnotic
work full of gestures and suggestions as to what could be
seen, putting into the minds of those present “shadowy
forms and faces.” In my estimation she is a subtle and
gifted assistant to Eva whom I do not believe to be honest.
On the contrary, I have no hesitation in saying that I
think the two simply took advantage of the credulity and
good nature of the various men with whom they had to
deal.</p>

<p>In this conclusion I am not alone, for in reviewing the
Villa Carmine seances of Mlle. Eva, Mr. Heuze states in
the <cite>London Telegraph</cite> of September 4th, 1922:</p>

<p>“The whiteness supposed to have come from the ‘world
beyond’ was nothing but a Communicant’s veil rolled up
in the medium’s pocket.”</p>

<p>He also quotes Mlle. Eva as saying:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I never made any confession.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” he comments, “all I can say is that
M. Carborrnel, M. Coulom, Maître Marsault, Maître Jourman,
Dr. Demis, Mlle. Mare, M. Verdier, Cochet M.
Portal, Mme. Portal and others must have all lied in a
body to persecute Mlle. Eva.”</p>

<p>Also the Sorbonne scientists at Paris, according to a
report in the <cite>New York Times</cite>, stated officially that during
fifteen seances with Mlle. Eva there was nothing beyond
the simple act of regurgitation. In two instances there
was no ectoplasm seen at any time in spite of the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
that Mme. Bisson suggested that two little discs produced
by Mlle. Eva were assuming forms and faces. None of
the professors, however, were able to see anything of the
kind, but on the contrary declared that:</p>

<p>“The substance was absolutely inert, only moving as
movement was given it by the medium’s mouth. The
substance having been reabsorbed the medium seemed
to be chewing for some seconds and then apparently
swallowed it.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>W. J. Crawford, Doctor of Science, and a lecturer on
Mechanical Engineering, of Belfast, Ireland, became very
much interested in a family of mediums consisting of a
father, four daughters, a son, and a son-in-law and known
as the Goligher Circle. Of the seven, the most successful
was Miss Kathleen Goligher.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>While at Mr. Feilding’s home in London I had the
pleasure of meeting this Dr. Crawford and talking with
him for several hours. During the talk he showed me
pictures of what he claimed was ectoplasm exuding from
different parts of Kathleen Goligher’s body and told me
he was going to use them in a forthcoming book.</p>

<p>“Do you honestly believe that everything you have
experienced through your contact and experiments with
the girl is absolutely genuine?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“I am positive in my belief,” he answered.</p>

<p>After he had gone Mr. Feilding turned to me and
asked:</p>

<p>“What do you think of Dr. Crawford?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>“He seems mad to me,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Houdini, you are mistaken,” he replied.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I do not think that Dr. Crawford was the
right man or had the right sort of a mind for an investigation.
To me his credulity seemed limitless. E. E.
Fournier d’Albe’s report of Dr. Crawford’s seance with
the Goligher Circle coincides with my judgment. In a
communication addressed to “Light” in August, 1922,
d’Albe referring to his own tenth seance says:</p>

<p>“I found to my surprise that I could myself with some
little management, produce the phenomena with my feet
exactly as I had observed them.”</p>

<p>Dr. Von Schrenk-Notzing<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> charged d’Albe with entering
his investigation with “prejudice against the genuineness
of the Goligher phenomena.” This d’Albe denied,
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had gone to Belfast fresh from Eva C’s seance with
a strong conviction of reality and with firm faith in Dr.
Crawford’s reliability and accuracy. I expected a gifted
medium surrounded by her honest folks, but then came
the blows: first, the contact photographs, then the evidences
of trickery. The sight of the ‘medium’ raising
a stool with her foot, filled me with bitter disappointment.
<em>The simple, honest folks all turned out to be
an alert, secretive, troublesome group of well-organized
performers.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Here is the experience of a man, who, with a mind
<em>prejudiced in favor</em>, entered upon a series of tests expecting
full confirmation of impressions already gotten from
his experiences with Eva C., but though ready to believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
not biased against the conclusions or rational deduction.
His summary, though brief, is worthy of note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Goligher Circle has repeatedly been urged, by
myself and others, to submit to further investigations by
a fresh investigator, but so far without success. If it
does consent, I can predict two things with confidence:</p>

<p>I. No genuine psychic phenomena will be observed.</p>

<p>II. No evidence of fraud will be obtained, as the
members of the Circle are exceedingly wary, and the
evidence of trickery which I obtained was gathered under
conditions which they had not foreseen, but which they
will doubtless avoid in the future.</p>

<p>“I also feel safe in predicting that if Miss Goligher’s
feet and hands are controlled, <em>and the cooperation of the
other sitters eliminated</em>, there will be no levitation of any
kind.</p>

<p>Poor Dr. Crawford! He committed suicide in Belfast
in 1920 and left a note saying that his research into
Spiritualism had nothing to do with his self-murder.
I am very sorry indeed that this sincere investigator became
his own judge because what he had written had
been done in good faith.</p>

<p>A short time after Dr. Crawford’s death his literary
executor requested Dr. d’Albe, early in 1921, to undertake
a further series of researches with the same medium
and circle in order, if possible, to obtain an independent
confirmation of his results and theories and to collect
more data concerning the nature of these manifestations.
d’Albe tells in his book how he caught Katie Goligher
manipulating and how he saw against the dim, red background
of the wall the stool held by Katie’s foot and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
portion of her leg. In some of these manipulations the
people around the table assisted.</p>

<p>When he left Belfast he wrote a very nice letter in
which he intimated that the result of his three months’
experience with the Goligher Circle did not furnish any
definite proofs of the psychic origin of the numerous
phenomena witnessed by him, and as they were of no
scientific value he had decided to have no more sittings.
It was suggested that Katie Goligher give twelve more
sittings under test conditions, but she refused on the
ground that her health would not permit her to entertain
such a proposal for at least a year.</p>

<p>I sat with d’Albe at one of Mlle. Eva’s seances. I
liked his methods and believe him to be a sincere investigator.
I have the following note from him in answer
to a letter of mine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">
Kingston-on-Thames.<br />
<span class="l1">October 10, 1922.</span>

<p class="in0">“Dear Houdini:</p>

<p>“Yours of the 26th ult. just received. Yes, the
Goligher legend has lost its glamour. I must say I was
greatly surprised at Crawford’s blindness....</p>

<p>In 1920, Capt. C. Marsh Beadnell, of London, published
a pamphlet in which he offered twenty pounds
if Dr. Crawford’s mediums would produce a single levitation
under conditions which would preclude trickery.
I am certain that any magician with a circle of six of
his own choosing and with only one observer of the
Crawford type could, under the same conditions, produce
effects much more startling than any of those recounted
by the trustful doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>The book to which Dr. Crawford referred when he
showed me the photographs he intended to use in it has,
since his death, been published by David Gow, Editor
of the Spiritualistic paper <cite>Light</cite>. In a prefatory note he
writes:</p>

<p>“I could say much about the present book with its
remarkable elucidation of many problems connected with
the psychical phenomena of Spiritualism, but I content
myself with a reference to such experiments as those
with the soft clay and the methylene blue, which finally
clear away certain suspicions which have always attached
to psychical mediums in connection with materialization
phenomena amongst uninstructed investigators. This is
not the least valuable part of a valuable book.”</p>

<p>The above statement raises the question of what bearing
any of these experiments, supposing every detail
claimed were a fact, has on a future state. What possible
information could impressions in clay, or stockings soiled
by dye, furnish concerning the future state of a soul?</p>

<p>Ejner Nielson, of Copenhagen, was sponsored by Dr.
Oscar Jaeger, Professor of Economics at the University
of Christiania, Norway, and President of the Norwegian
Society for Psychical Research. Professor Jaeger was
invited by the Editor of the <i>Politikon</i>, at Copenhagen,
to hold a seance with Neilson. He accepted and it took
place in January, 1922, before a specially selected committee<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
appointed by the president of the Norwegian
University, Professor Frederick Stange. A few weeks
later the committee reported that Nielson had not been
capable of producing any so-called teleplasma or phenomena
of materialization. Subsequently the Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
for Psychical Research reported that teleplasma had
been “artificially brought into the body of the medium.”</p>

<p>Paul Heuze, writing of the Polish medium, in the
<cite>London Daily Telegraph</cite> of September 18, 1922,
says:</p>

<p>“S. D. Stamislaski arrived in Paris on April 7th. On
the 10th he had an interview at the Sorbonne with
Professor Piéron and on the 11th I went, at his request,
to take part in the initial seance which was held in a
bedroom of his hotel. This was, of course, merely a
preparatory seance. My impression was not at all
favorable.”</p>

<p>In speaking of the subsequent seances of this medium
he declares:</p>

<p>“The whole thing may be summed up in a single
sentence; the result was pitiable. Suffice it to say that
in spite of inadequate control, not only did I never see
any of the luminous phenomena of the first seances but
that hardly anything took place at all and when it did
it was merely one of those clumsy pieces of deception that
are practiced in the most ordinary Spiritualistic seances:—Articles
moved, thrown forward, touchings, slaps, books
dropped on the head, etc. The whole thing carried out
in such a manner that there could not be the slightest
doubt as to the gross trickery with which it was
performed.”</p>

<p>I have personally attended seances held by two of the
ectoplasmic mediums, Mlle. Eva and Mrs. Thompson,
and I have no doubt that it is only a question of time
when all such mediums, as well as these two, including
Stamislawa, P. Frank Kluski, S. G. Stamislaski, Jean
Guzek,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Kathleen Goligher, Ejner Nielson, Frau Siebert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and Willy Sch, will be authentically classified as
questionable.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, I am not a skeptic. It is my will to
believe and if convincing evidence is brought forward I
will be the first to acknowledge my mistake, but up to
the present day nothing has crossed my path to make me
think that the Great Almighty will allow emanations from
a human body of such horrible, revolting, viscous substances
as Baron Von Schrenk Notzing claims, hideous
shapes, which, like “genii from the bronze bottle,” ring
bells, move handkerchiefs, wobble tables, and do other
“flap-doodle” stunts.</p>

<span class="subhead">BY-PRODUCTS OF SPIRITUALISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> has come to my attention in talking to numbers of
laymen that the general public thinks of Spiritualism
only in terms of mediums and seances and that the average
man does not seem to realize the suffering, losses,
misfortunes, crimes and atrocities of which it is the underlying
cause and must bear the primary responsibility.
During the more than thirty years in which I have been
investigating Spiritualism I have industriously collected
all possible data on the subject and in the thousands of
clippings, dating from 1854 to the present time, which
are filed away in my library, there are hundreds which
tell of crimes attributable to Spiritualism. In my great
collection of books there are many by world-renowned
writers, men of science, physicians, and philosophers,
each dealing with the curse of Spiritualism. It touches
every phase of human affairs and emotions, leaving in its
wake a crowd of victims whose plight is frequently
pathetic, sometimes ludicrous, oftener miserable and
unfortunate, and who are always deluded. It is to these
effects of Spiritualism which are seldom considered that I
wish to call the reader’s attention in this chapter.</p>

<p>The <cite>New York Herald</cite> on June 16, 1923, told under
a Syracuse date line the following incident:</p>

<p>“William H. Burr of Rochester, speaking to-day at the
business session of the New York State Assembly of
Spiritualists, of which he is President, said he could prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
scientifically and conclusively the fact of communication
with the Spirit world. Mr. Burr appealed for the abolition
of capital punishment. He explained that he had
communicated with Spirits from the bodies of murderers
and realized their sufferings, as those skeptical of psychic
communication never can.”</p>

<p>The <cite>New York Evening World</cite> of March 8, 1922, reports
that:</p>

<p>“Thurs Bergen Vigelius, a student in chemistry, of
Brooklyn, N. Y., with faith that a Spiritual ‘glimpse’
of the hereafter and power to write a book thereof would
be a distinct contribution to science and literature if he
could ‘project himself into a comatose condition simulating
death,’ drugged himself frequently into experimental
sleep, but on his last experiment his consciousness not
only deserted him, but breath and life accompanied it.
He was regarded as an exceptionally bright student with
every prospect of a promising career, had he not been
susceptible to a fallacious belief.”</p>

<p>One of the saddest cases of modern times is that of
the young Barnard College student, Miss Marie Bloomfield,
who declared herself in love with a Spirit and finally
was driven to suicide in order to join him. The young
lady had been an ardent student of Spiritualism and very
active in its cause. All the newspapers of February 9,
1923, carried an account of her death, which attracted
so much attention that a law was proposed in the New
York Assembly to prevent seances but it failed of being
passed.</p>

<p>The <cite>Washington Times</cite> (D. C.) of January 14, 1923,
tells of an Earl L. Clark who secured a divorce on the
grounds that his wife claimed that she had a “Spirit
affinity” named Alfred and that this Alfred through
Clark’s wife made his life unbearable, even predicting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
his death so that she might marry some man who would
“accept Alfred’s Spiritual guidance.”</p>

<p>According to an account in the <cite>New York World</cite>, John
Slater, chief medium of the National Spiritualists Association,
claims that there were over five hundred Spiritualists
who served with the American Expeditionary Force,
none of which were wounded or afflicted with “cooties.”
The freedom from wounds he attributed to the influence
of Spirits.</p>

<p>The <cite>New York Times</cite> on April 27, 1922, told of a
John Cornyn, in San Francisco, who shot and killed two
of his boys, one seven and the other eight, because, according
to the police, he had been in “communication”
with his wife who had been dead a year and she “had
asked him to send all of their five children to her.”</p>

<p>The following story in the <cite>New York Times</cite> of April
22, 1887, comes from Philadelphia:</p>

<p>“The jury in the case of Mrs. Sarah Patterson, an
alleged medium, charged by the County Medical Society
with practising medicine and surgery without being registered
as a physician, this afternoon returned a verdict of
guilty. The defence set up by the defendant’s counsel
was that Mrs. Patterson was a medium and under the control
of Spirits, and was not therefore responsible for what
she did in a trance. The defendant’s counsel are both
Spiritualists and the case has attracted considerable interest,
the court room being crowded since the trial began.”</p>

<p>These are the sort of things for which Spiritualism is
responsible that are being told of in the papers frequently.
To these few examples I could add hundreds from my
files and they are constantly growing.</p>

<p>A hoax which usually creates a sensation, but which
is apt, ultimately, to have a decidedly bad effect on
believers’ nerves, consists in allowing some person to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
touch or even fondle a materialized Spirit. One such
demonstration occurred in a Southern city, where there
lived a medium known as Mrs. M——. Her seances
were always well attended and largely made up of the
elite of the town. On one particular night a Spirit came
forth and called for Andrew, saying in the most austere
tones:</p>

<p>“I am the Spirit of ‘Josie’ and I want to see my beloved
whom I left twenty years ago. I know that he is present
and that he wants to hear from me, and more important,
I know he still loves me, for in those twenty years he has
never married.”</p>

<p>With trembling knees and shaking hands the man
climbed to the stage and in the midst of sobs recognized
and embraced his sweetheart. It was a very touching
and pathetic scene and the believers were greatly affected,
and at some one’s suggestion an ex-minister and editor of
a Spiritualistic magazine, who was present, married the
Spirit bride to the live groom. It was a sensational proof
of mediumship and Mrs. M—— was headlined in all the
local papers. Unfortunately, however, for the cause of
Spiritualism, my old friend, Professor Harry Cook, happened
to be in the neighborhood and on hearing about
it hired a hall, challenged the medium to a test, and with
a lady assistant performed and exposed the miracle.</p>

<p>I recall another instance where one of my friends was
investigating a materialization seance. It was claimed
that the Spirit of his deceased wife was manifesting and
he asked permission to kiss her. This was graciously
granted and he told me later that she must have forgotten
to shave for she had a stubble beard. Incidentally I
might add that while he attended the seance his real wife
waited for him at a nearby theatre.</p>

<p>Such an eminent scientist as Sir William Crookes evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
fell for the materialization hoax, judging from what
he tells us about his experience at a seance where
Florence Cook was the medium and Katie King the
phantom. I will quote the story in his own words as
he tells it in his book “Researches in Spiritualism.”</p>

<p>“Several times she took my arm and the impression I
received that it was a living woman at my side and not
a visitor from the other world was so strong that the
temptation to repeat a recent and curious experiment
became almost irresistible.</p>

<p>“Realizing then that if it were not a Spirit beside me
it was in any case a lady, I asked her permission to take
her in my arms in order to verify the interesting observation
that a bold experimenter had recently made known.
This permission was graciously given, and I took advantage
of it respectfully, as any gentleman would have
done in the same circumstances. The ‘ghost,’ which
made no resistance, was a being as material as Miss Cook
herself.</p>

<p>“Katie then declared that on this occasion she felt able
to show herself at the same time as Miss Cook. I lowered
the gas and with my phosphorus lamp entered the room
which served as a cabinet. It was dark and I groped for
Miss Cook, finding her crouched upon the floor. Kneeling
down, I let the air enter my lamp and by its light
saw the young woman dressed in black velvet, as she
had been at the beginning of the seance, and appearing
completely insensible.</p>

<p>“She did not stir when I took her hand and held the
lamp near her face, but she continued to breathe quietly.
Raising my lamp, I looked around me and saw Katie,
who was standing close behind Miss Cook. She was clad
in flowing white drapery, as we had already seen her in
the seance. Holding one of Miss Cook’s hands in mine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
and still kneeling, I raised and lowered the lamp, as
much to illuminate the whole figure of Katie as to convince
myself fully that I really saw the true Katie, whom
I had held in my arms a few moments ago, and not the
phantom of a disordered brain.</p>

<p>“She did not speak but nodded her head in recognition.
Three different times I carefully examined Miss Cook,
crouching before me, to assure myself that the hand I
held was indeed that of a living woman, and thrice turned
my lamp toward Katie to scrutinize her with sustained
attention, until I had not the slightest doubt that she
was really there before me.”</p>

<p>Another instance of this sort is told of by Florence
Marryat in her book “There Is No Death.”</p>

<p>“I opened the curtains of the cabinet and there stood
John Powles himself, stalwart and living. He stepped
up brusquely and took me in his arms and kissed me,
four or five times, as a long departed brother might have
done; and strange to say, I did not feel the least surprised
at it, but clung to him like a sister. John Powles had
never once kissed me during his life time. Although
we had lived for four years in the closest intimacy, often
under the same roof, we had never indulged in any
familiarity.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately mere deception is not the only or the
worst evil in these Spiritualistic materializations. Frequently
they are made the means of accomplishing criminal
designs. There came to my attention a case of a
very peculiar nature in which a widow was robbed of a
large fortune. It appears that there was a wealthy old
widower, a devoted Spiritualist, who was easily influenced
by certain mediums. These same mediums also had
among their clients a rather weak-minded widow. At a
seance they got the old man to propose marriage to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
widow who, in turn, was being advised through them
by the Spirit of her husband to marry the old man. The
old man did not live very long after the wedding and on
his death bed promised the woman that he would come
back to aid her and give her financial advice. He had
previously made a will giving her absolute control of his
estate.</p>

<p>The body was taken to an undertaking establishment
to be cared for until the funeral and on the day before
the service the widow attended a seance at which her
husband told her:</p>

<p>“You go to my coffin to-morrow morning before the
ceremony and I will speak to you, giving you my final
instructions from my mortal body.”</p>

<p>The next morning, accompanied by a nurse, the woman
went to the undertaker’s and was taken to the room where
the body lay in its casket. She spoke and to her astonishment
the corpse opened its eyes and said:</p>

<p>“I want you to give half of the fortune I willed you to
B—— and M——, the mediums. They have helped me
for years and I would like to show them my appreciation.
Farewell, I will speak to you at seances but never again
from the body.”</p>

<p>The astounded widow threw herself on the body crying:</p>

<p>“I promise! I will! I promise!”</p>

<p>“Promise?” asked the corpse.</p>

<p>“I promise faithfully,” she replied.</p>

<p>True to her word, the widow divided the fortune with
the mediums, who are now in foreign countries living a
peaceful life unless troubled by their consciences.</p>

<p>The deception was worked as follows: the mediums,
taking advantage of the undertaker’s weakness, kept him
intoxicated and were thus free to do whatever they cared
to around his establishment. The casket was arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
with a false bottom which ran in and out on ball bearings
and one end was made to open. Just before the widow’s
visit to the undertaking establishment this false bottom
with the old man’s body was run out of the casket and
hidden in an adjoining room and one of the mediums,
made up to represent the dead man, was placed in the
casket. As soon as the act was over the corpse was put
back in its proper place.</p>

<p>This is not the only instance of this sort by any means.
I have known of two other instances in which corpses
have been used for purposes of fraud. In one a man was
dying. A lawyer was sent for and the nurse gotten out
of the way on some plausible excuse. After the man died,
but before the lawyer arrived, his body was hidden under
the bed. One of the gang took his place in the bed and
dictated a will with gasping breath and afterwards made
his mark in the presence of a perfectly honest attorney
and witness. Before the nurse got back the corpse
had been placed in the bed and there was nothing to
show that a fraud had been committed.</p>

<p>To show that such things are possible and that exchanging
bodies in a coffin can be accomplished, I want
to call attention to the coffin act which I did for the Boston
Athletic Association. A solid oak coffin was furnished by
the National Casket Company and delivered to the Association.
Six-inch screws were used to fasten down the
lid but I managed to escape nevertheless, leaving no
traces.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that Charles J. Guiteau, the
assassin of President Garfield, was a pronounced Spiritualist.
He claimed that he was inspired by the Spirits
four times. Once in connection with his entering the
Oneida community. Once preceding his attempt to establish
a newspaper called “The Theocrat.” Again when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
writing his book “The Truth a Companion to the Bible,”
and still again when he was inspired to kill the President.</p>

<p>Another case in which Spirits were claimed to have
been responsible for diverting funds is told in “The
Fallacies of Spiritualism.”</p>

<p>“In September, 1920, an action was brought in the
New York Courts against a medium named Mrs. Mabelle
Hirons, for the recovery of twelve thousand four hundred
dollars, alleged to have been obtained by ‘Spiritualistic’
means from Dr. J. B. Hubbell, of Rockville, Maryland.
Dr. Hubbell declared that after the death of Clara Barton,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
founder of the American Red Cross, to whom he had been
secretary, it was intended to erect a memorial to that lady,
to which he proposed contributing twelve thousand four
hundred dollars of his own money, including nine hundred
dollars bequeathed him by Clara Barton herself.
In 1914 he visited Mrs. Hirons, who, he said, went into
a trance and gave him a ‘message’ that was supposed to
come from Clara Barton and which directed him to give
all the money to Mrs. Hirons for the memorial. Dr.
Hubbell believed the ‘message’ to be genuine and gave
her the money, but the memorial was never erected—hence
the action.”</p>

<p>A few years ago the papers told of the case of a woman
in the Middle West who was sensationally and cruelly
deceived by a medium. When she lost her little girl it
was feared that she would not recover from the intense
grief with which she was overcome. On the woman’s
farm was a hired man whose wife was a medium. He
talked sympathetically with her and got her to allow him
to send for his wife, who was in Chicago. She began
preaching Spiritualism as soon as she arrived, finding the
woman a willing listener. When it was apparent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
medium that the woman thoroughly believed her doctrine
she began to advise her to pray nightly for the restoration
of her child and finally one night she announced to the
credulous woman that at midnight four days later her
child would be restored to her. She cautioned her that
she must fast that day, dress her room and bed in white,
and sleep alone that night. The instructions were followed
to the letter. At midnight she heard the stairs
creak. Then suddenly her door was pushed open and
she saw something luminous approaching her bed. It
carried a bundle and a voice announced that her daughter
was coming back to her. After the apparition left the
woman found a baby girl in the bed with her. Soon after
the medium persuaded the woman and her husband to
dispose of their property and go to a Spirit Colony in
California. After nearly three years they came back to
their home with practically no means but with the knowledge
that the baby girl came from a foundling society in
Chicago.</p>

<p>Not the least of the evils of Spiritualism is the insanity
which it causes. A mental specialist of high standing in
Birmingham, England, issued a warning in 1922 quoting
numerous cases which came under his observation and
were the result of Spiritualistic teaching. An English
doctor has estimated the number of such cases at a
million. It is a well-established fact that the human
reason gives way under the exciting strain of Spiritualism.
The list is not limited to European countries; we have
a goodly share of baneful results right at home. Not long
ago Dr. Curry, Medical Director of the State Insane
Asylum of New Jersey, issued a warning concerning the
“Ouija-board” in which he said:</p>

<p>“The ‘Ouija-board’ is especially serious because it is
adopted mainly by persons of high-strung neurotic tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
who become victims of actual illusions of sight,
hearing and touch at Spiritualistic seances.”</p>

<p>He predicted that the insane asylums would be flooded
with patients if popular taste did not swing to more
wholesome diversions.</p>

<p>In March, 1920, it was reported in the papers that
the craze for the Ouija-boards, with which it was thought
spirit messages could be received, had reached such a
pitch in the little village of Carrito, across San Francisco
Bay, that five people had been driven mad.</p>

<p>The available amount of evidence of this sort is almost
unbelievable, but enough has been given to show the
extent of the evil. The average medium works only for
the money he or she can extract from the public; money
obtained by moving the deepest sentiments in the human
soul. Is it right to legally sanction the medium, to allow
him to prey on the public—not only allowing him to take
the earthly possessions of his victims, but their soul, and
oftentimes their mind as well? Spiritualism is nothing
more or less than mental intoxication, the intoxication
of words, of feelings and suggested beliefs. Intoxication
of any sort when it becomes a habit is injurious to the
body but intoxication of the mind is always fatal to the
mind. We have prohibition of alcohol, we have prohibition
of drugs, but we have no law to prevent these
human leeches from sucking every bit of reason and
common sense from their victims. It ought to be stopped,
it must be stopped, and it would seem that the multiplicity
of exposures and the multitude of prosecutions
that have followed rational investigation should be sufficient
to justify, yes, demand legislation for the complete
annihilation of a cult built on false pretence, flimsy hear-say
evidence, and the absurdity of accepting an optical
<em>illusion</em> as a fact.</p>

<span class="subhead">INVESTIGATIONS—WISE AND
OTHERWISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Spiritualism</span> has been the cause of much discussion
between men of science, men of magic, and believers in
the “Spirit World.” Countless investigations, wise and
otherwise, have been held in most of the countries of the
globe. Many of them have been made by fair-minded,
unbiased men; men who delved deep into the unknown
with a clear conscience and whether successful or not were
willing to give the world the result of their probings.
Men who were not afraid to admit that their experience
was not sufficient to cope with the medium’s skill and
years of training and that they had been fooled. But
there have been other so-called investigators who have
attended seances wishing to be fooled and as “the wish is
father of the thought” they have been misled.</p>

<p>What these investigators <em>see</em> done and what they <em>think</em>
they see done are in reality two entirely different things
and by the time they start to write their experiences there
are usually complications. I rarely believe a full hundred
per cent the explanations I hear or read. It is to
be said to the credit of the investigators that they do not
deliberately make misstatements but the nature of the
brain is such that it is almost impossible to avoid mal-observation
and these mal-observations are the curse of
investigation.</p>

<p>Investigations under conditions favorable to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
medium cannot be termed “investigations.” They are
nothing more than a demonstration of the medium’s
power to divert the attention, carrying it at will to any
place they wish and numbing the subconscious mind.
Under such conditions they are not only able to delude
the innocent and simple-minded but also men whose
accomplishments have proven their intellects to be above
the average.</p>

<p>When a medium is subjected to conditions which are,
to say the least, disconcerting, and the usual effects are
not obtained, almost invariably the claim is made that
there are antagonistic waves and that the “auras” are bad,
and if, as often happens, the result is an unqualified
exposé and the medium’s fall from power the followers
of Spiritualism usually put forth a statement saying the
medium overstepped the bounds in trying to give results
and resorted to trickery, but that the majority of previous
seances were genuine.</p>

<p>Perhaps my ideas on the subject of how to conduct
an investigation are wrong; I am fully convinced, however,
that the only way to conduct a successful one is to
get the committee together previous to the seance, discuss
the expected manifestations, formulate some plan for
concerted action and if possible assign each member some
specific part as was done in the case of Palladino’s fall.
These parts should be rehearsed and then when the seance
is held there is a much greater possibility of the committee
being able to judge intelligently. But when
scientists report some feat of legerdemain as being abnormal
simply because they cannot detect the deception,
I think it is time to add to each investigating committee
a successful and reputable professional mystifier, and I
might add that all mediums hate to have a magician
attend a seance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>Of the many investigations, since the beginning of
modern Spiritualism, I have selected a few of the most
important and will try and show the reader the necessity
of placing on investigating committees men who cannot
be prejudiced or influenced by subdued lights or weird
and mystifying sounds; men who use their God-given
gift of reason to the best of their ability; men whose attention
cannot be diverted by the medium; men whose
brain cells are versatile and not overdeveloped in one
particular direction; men who can pay strict attention to
their commission and not be led astray by the glib-tongued
medium’s misdirection. Then we will have real investigations
and the world at large will benefit.</p>

<p>A short time before his death Henry Seybert, an enthusiastic
Spiritualist with a conscientious desire that
Spiritualism should be authentically established, gave the
University of Pennsylvania sufficient money to establish a
chair of Philosophy on condition that a commission should
be appointed to investigate “all systems of morals, Religion
or Philosophy which assume to represent the <em>truth</em>
and particularly modern Spiritualism.” Accordingly
there were selected from among the doctors and professors
of the University ten men to be known as the “Seybert
Commission.” A fairer-minded and more impartial commission
could not have been appointed. Each man had
declared himself holding an open mind and ready to
accept whatever there was evidence to prove, but realizing
“that men eminent in intelligence and attainment
yield to Spiritualism an entire credence,” they felt that
one could not “fail to stand aside in tender reverence
when crushed and bleeding hearts are seen to seek it for
consolation and for hope.” In order to be amply prepared
to do their work in an intelligent and understanding
manner they provided themselves with the best literature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
of the day on the subject and such records of previous
investigations as were available. After a careful digest
of all this information the Commission was ready to begin
its actual work in March, 1884. <em>The entire ten men</em> of
the Commission <em>were willing to believe</em>, and their adviser,
Mr. Thomas R. Hazard, had been a personal friend of
Mr. Seybert and was known throughout the land as an
<em>uncompromising Spiritualist</em>.”</p>

<p>The first medium to which the Commission gave its
attention was Mrs. S. E. Patterson, a slate writing mystifier
and automatic writer. The result of this first case
was <em>nil</em>. After waiting patiently an hour and a half for
the spirits to move the meeting adjourned to the disappointment
of all. Mr. Hazard was especially chagrined,
for the medium was considered “one of the very best in
the world.” She had given him a private sitting the evening
before at which “messages from the Spirit of Henry
Seybert came thick and fast,” but they declined to manifest
for the Commission.</p>

<p>This seance proved to be typical of all that fell to the
lot of the Seybert Commission to investigate. It continued
its work for three years and investigated every case
of importance which came before it. One of these was
Margaret Fox, with whom the Commission had two sittings
and became convinced that the raps came from her person.
When she was told of its conclusion she admitted that the
seances were not satisfactory but declined further sittings
on the ground of ill health and because she doubted if more
satisfactory results would follow and admitting that they
might result in a “<em>confirmation</em>” of the Commission’s belief
as to the cause of the raps.</p>

<p>Many of the most prominent mediums of the day appeared
before the Commission during its three years of
work. Some of them underwent a whole series of tests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
and the phenomena covered the whole gamut from simple
rapping to spirit photography, automatic and slate writing,
materialization, etc. In every case with but one
exception the result was either a blank seance, a positive
failure, or a deliberate cheat. The exception was when
Mr. Harry Kellar was called in as a magician to demonstrate
his power as a slate writer. The Commission was
successfully baffled, not a single member being able to
fathom his method until he explained it.</p>

<p>The Commission carefully weighed all the evidence
placed before it and formed its conclusions with such
deliberation and thoroughness that the most critical on
either side found no cause for objecting or saying that
it was swayed or biased by any undue influence whatever.
It pursued its work on purely rational, scientific lines,
strenuously avoiding all conditions which might be construed
as conducive to doubtful conclusions. It was
looking for facts in a matter-of-fact way and as there was
no opportunity for screening artifices no occult or psychic
phenomena were proven to have existed. As an evidence
of the fairness with which the Commission was considered
to have done its work, I quote the following letter to the
Commission from Dr. Henry Slade.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">
“No. 11 E. 13th Street, N. Y., Feb. 4, 1885.
</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Furness:—I take this opportunity to express
to you, and through you to the other members of
the Seybert Commission, my hearty approval of the course
pursued by them in their investigation of phenomena
occurring in my presence. Fully realizing that I am only
the instrument or channel through which these manifestations
are produced, it would be presumption on my
part to undertake to lay down a line to be followed by
the unseen intelligence, whose servant I am. Hence I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
did say their conditions must be acceded to or I would
return to New York. That they did so, is evident to my
mind from the results obtained, which I regard as a
necessary preliminary to a continuation, when other experiments
may be introduced with better prospects of
success. It may be well not to insist on following the
exact course followed by Professor Zollner, but leave
it open to original or impromptu suggestions that may be
adopted without previous consideration, which, if successful,
would be of equal value as evidence of its genuineness,
at the same time give greater breadth to the
experiments. In conclusion, allow me to say that in
the event the Committee desires to continue these experiments
through another series of sittings with me, it will
give me pleasure to enter into arrangements for that
purpose.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Very truly yours,</span><br />
“Henry Slade.”
</p>
</div>

<p>If all the investigators were to adopt the rational methods
of the Seybert Commission they might easily discover
the truth and no longer submit to imposition by charlatans
nor aid and abet them by accepting as true the claims
made by a class which they admit is of a low type, dishonest,
and otherwise disreputable. If sincere, they
would assist in all reasonable attempts to detect fraud
and not accept the irrational pretext that light and touch
are detrimental to the health or life of a medium.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of the Seybert Commission
the Society for Psychical Research was organized in
America and England for the purpose of investigating
all so-called phenomena and freak occurrences not easily
accountable for by natural law and in spite of the following
message which it is claimed was sent by the spirit
of the late William Walker, President of the Buxton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Camera Club, to the Crewe Circle, I believe they are doing
good work.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="in0">“Dear Friends of the Circle,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>“I would not spend a moment with the Psychical Research
Society, because they are nothing more or less
than fraud hunters and I want you to come to Buxton for
a sitting with Mrs. Walker, 3, Palace Rd., about the 8th,
9th, of Aug. Then the spirit friends can further demonstrate
the wondrous powers which to-day are needed more
than ever. Peace be with you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Yours faithfully,</span><br />
“W. Walker.”
</p>
</div>

<p>The membership of these societies is made up of men
and women who have a certain degree of scientific training,
all classes of scholarship and all professions being
represented. As a consequence the investigations have
been most exhaustive and carried out by persons especially
qualified for the work, but the results have been most
emphatically against a belief in the return of a soul after
death in the guise of a spirit or the occurrence of anything
supernatural at the bidding of a medium.</p>

<p>Naturally, we might not expect a general agreement
among a group of scientific scholars who had entered the
field of research from different points of view, but I
believe I can say without fear of contradiction, that of all
who have undertaken the task without prejudice the majority
agree in the opinion that all phenomena ascribed
to spirit power developed through, and presented by, a
medium, are without foundation in fact, and that the result
of their investigations has agreed perfectly with the findings
of the Seybert Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>In January, 1869, the London Dialectical Society appointed
a committee with thirty-three members to investigate
the phenomena alleged to be Spiritual manifestations
and to report on its findings. Professor Huxley, Professor
John Tyndall, and Mr. George Henry Lewes, were
invited to co-operate with the Committee. Professor
Huxley refused to have anything to do with the investigation
and in the following letter, written in answer to
the Committee’s invitation, he terms Spiritualism a
“gross imposture.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir,—I regret that I am unable to accept the invitation
of the Council of the Dialectical Society to co-operate
with a Committee for the investigation of ‘Spiritualism’,
and for two reasons. In the first place, I have no time
for such an inquiry, which would involve much trouble
and (unless it were unlike all inquiries of that kind I
have known) much annoyance. In the second place,
I take no interest in the subject. The only case of ‘Spiritualism’
I have had the opportunity of examining into for
myself was as gross an imposture as ever came under my
notice. But supposing the phenomena to be genuine—they
do not interest me. If anybody would endow me with
the faculty of listening to the chatter of old women and
curates in the nearest cathedral town, I would decline the
privilege, having better things to do.</p>

<p>“And if the folk in the Spiritual world do not talk
more wisely and sensibly than their friends report them
to do, I put them in the same category.</p>

<p>“The only good that I can see in a demonstration of
the truth of ‘Spiritualism’ is to furnish an additional
argument against suicide. Better live a crossing-sweeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
than die and be made to talk twaddle by a ‘medium’ hired
at a guinea a <em>seance</em>.</p>

<p>A few days later Mr. Lewes declined the Committee’s
invitation as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Sir,—I shall not be able to attend the investigation
of ‘Spiritualism’; and in reference to your question
about suggestions would only say that the one hint
needful is that all present should distinguish between
facts and inferences from facts. When any man says that
phenomena are produced by <em>no</em> known physical laws, he
declares that he knows the laws by which they are
produced.</p>

</p>

<p>“Tuesday, 2nd February, 1869.”</p>
</div>

<p>Under date of December 22, 1869, Professor Tyndall
wrote the following in response to his invitation to aid
the Committee.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir—You mention in your note to me three gentlemen,
two of whom are personally known to me, and for
both of whom I entertain a sincere esteem.</p>

<p>“The house of one of these, namely Mr. Wallace, I
have already visited, and made there the acquaintance of
the lady who was the reputed medium between Mr.
Wallace and the supernatural.</p>

<p>“And if earnestly invited by Mr. Crookes, the editor
of the ‘Chemical News,’ to witness phenomena which in
his opinion ‘tend to demonstrate the existence of some
power (magnetic or otherwise) which has not yet been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
recognized by men of science,’ I should pay due respect
to his invitation.</p>

<p>“But understand my position: more than a year ago
Mr. Cromwell Varley, who is, I believe, one of the greatest
modern Spiritualists, did me the favor to pay me a visit,
and he then employed a comparison which, though flattering
to my spiritual strength, seems to mark me out as
unfit for spiritual investigation. He said that my presence
at a <em>seance</em> resembled that of a great magnet among a
number of small ones. I throw all into confusion. Still
he expressed a hope that arrangements might be made to
show me the phenomena, and I expressed my willingness
to witness such things as Mr. Varley might think worth
showing to me. I have not since been favored by a visit
from Mr. Varley.</p>

<p>“I am now perfectly willing to accept the personal

<p>Unlike the Seybert Commission, which made a formal
report to the University of Pennsylvania immediately on
the completion of its work, the Committee of the Dialectical
Society which was appointed in 1869 did not make
any report until 1877 and then only what seems to be
a garbled report of sub-committees. The <cite>Spiritual
Magazine</cite> in 1870 commented on this lack of a report
as follows:</p>

<p>“Where is the report of the Dialectical Society? This
is the question which many people are asking, but to
which no one seems prepared to give a satisfactory reply.
Has this Report, which was to settle the question of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Spiritualism, only unsettled the Dialectical Society—causing,
as we learn, some of its principal officers and
members to secede from it on finding that the investigations
of the Committee pointed in a different way to what
they anticipated, and to which they had committed themselves?
People ask—Have the Committee come to an
opinion on the subject or have they too many opinions?”</p>

<p>The only information I have come in contact with
referring to the Dialectical Committee and its work has
been from Spiritualistic publications, most of them under
authorship of Mr. James Burns, and I copy the following
from “The Medium and Daybreak” of November 16,
1877:</p>

<p>“Objection has been taken in some quarters to the fact
that the Society itself did not publish the Report, but
left the matter of the publication as an open question to
its Committee.” Again: on the 20th of July, 1870, the
council passed a resolution—“that the request of the
Committee, that the Report be printed under the authority
of the Society, be not acceded to.”</p>

<p>The exact nature of the work done by the Dialectical
Society’s Committee can be summed up by another extract
from the same issue of “The Medium and Daybreak”:</p>

<p>“In due time the Committee presented to the Council
the General and Sub-Reports, supplementing the same by
a voluminous mass of evidence taken directly from the
<em>lips of Spiritualists practically acquainted with the subject—persons
of the highest respectability and representing
nearly every grade of society</em>.” (The italics are mine.)</p>

<p>Another element of discord in the Dialectical investigation
is shown by the following:</p>

<p>“Attempt has been made, of course, to undervalue
these telling researches. The non-successful Committees
have been brought gleefully into prominence, in hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
that <em>positive</em> results obtained by the successful Committees
might thereby be discredited.”</p>

<p>It seems to be a published fact that this movement on
the part of the Dialectical Society resulted in much discord
amounting to a split in the Society. Mr. Burns in
his editorial column of the “Medium and Daybreak” says:</p>

<p>“Our present issue affords an important and valuable
addition to the cheap literature of Spiritualism. It is
filled with useful matter for investigators, <em>judiciously
extracted from the Report of the London Dialectical
Society</em>.” (My italics.)</p>

<p>The supporters of Spiritualism lay great stress and
importance on the fact that a few of their co-workers are
men prominent in scientific and literary circles, but these
are in such a minority, when compared with men of the
same time who do not co-operate, that the Spiritualists in
order to give force and dignity to their argument “ring the
changes” on these few names and keep them prominently
to the front, notwithstanding that it has been proven
beyond question, time and again, that these sages themselves
have frequently been the victims of fraudulent
mediums, sometimes knowingly.</p>

<p>Doyle in his book “The New Revelation” says:</p>

<p>“The days are surely passing when the mature and
considerate opinions of such men ... can be dismissed
with the empty ‘all rot’ or ‘nauseating drivel’ formulæ.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent man in this respect and
whose conclusions, especially in his later years, were
pointed to by Spiritualists as being beyond dispute was
the eminent chemist, Sir William Crookes. He became
intensely interested in Spiritualistic research work as early
as 1870 and for the first four years devoted most of his
attention to D. D. Home, who seemed successful in
baffling Crookes’ super-knowledge of scientific investigation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
In 1874 he turned his attention to Florrie Cook,
a fifteen year old medium who had been commanding
attention for about three years. She seems to have captivated
him within the first month to such an extent that
he went to her defense in print after a “<em>disgraceful occurrence</em>”
had given rise to a “<em>controversy</em>,” after which he
entertained her at his house. The most convincing test,
though, took place at her home in Hackney. In February,
1874, he wrote:</p>

<p>“These <em>seances</em> have not been going on many weeks
but enough has taken place to thoroughly convince me
of the perfect truth and honesty of Miss Cook, and to
give me every reason to expect that the promises so freely
made to me by Katie will be kept. All I now ask is that
your readers will not hastily assume that everything which
is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prima facie</i> suspicious necessarily implies deception,
and that they will suspend their judgment until they hear
from me again on this subject.”</p>

<p>It was not long, evidently, before the scientist awoke
from his dream, for on August 1st, 1874, he wrote to a
Russian lady that after four years of investigation, including
months of experience with Home, Katie Fox, and
Florence Cook, he found “no satisfactory proof that the
dead can return and communicate.” A copy of this letter
was sent by Aksakoff to <i>Light</i>, and was published in that
journal on May 12, 1900. “Sir W. Crookes did not
dissent.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Sometime along about 1875 forty-four photographic
negatives which he had made of Katie King and
her medium, Florrie Cook, together with what prints he
had, were, for some reason not given, accidentally destroyed
and he forbade friends who had copies to reproduce
them. He must have made some sort of a discovery
for he “buried himself in a sulky silence which he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
not break” for forty years. “No one knew whether he
was a Spiritualist or not,” his only statement being that
“in all his Spiritualistic research he had ‘come to a brick
wall.’”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> In 1914 when asked plainly if he were a
Spiritualist “he evaded the question.” Perhaps the
change in his opinions came over him when he learned
that Florence Cook (who became Mrs. Corner) was
exposed<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> on a continental tour and sent back disgraced.
But in 1916, notwithstanding his statement in 1900 and
other previous statements, he went on record in the
December 9th issue of <i>Light</i> as accepting Spiritualism.</p>

<p>All of this stands as proof that Professor Crookes,
even after he was knighted, was of a vacillating mind
and for some reason seemed to be deficient in rational
methods of discovering the truth, or at least disinclined
to put them in force outside of his particular line of
science. Possibly, one of the convincing proofs to him
may have been the “tricks” played on him by Annie Eva
Fay, for if I am not in error his failure to detect her
trickery was the turning point which brought him to a
belief in Spiritualism. She told me that when Maskelyne,
the magician, came out with an exposé of her work she
was forced to resort to strategy. Going to the home of
Professor Crookes she threw herself on his mercy and
gave a series of special tests. With flashing eyes she
told of taking advantage of him. It appears that she
had but one chance in the world to get by the galvanometer<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
but by some stroke of luck for her and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
evil chance for Professor Crookes, the electric light went
out for a second at the theatre at which she was performing,
and she availed herself of the opportunity to fool
him. One of the tests was duplicated by Professor Harry
Cooke, a magician.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this
brainy man was hoodwinked, and that his confidence was
betrayed by the so-called mediums that he tested. His
powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning
faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything
psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist
the influence.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> This seems more difficult to comprehend
when one remembers that he did not accept Spiritualism
in full until he was nearing the end of his earthly career.
The weakness and unreliability of Sir William’s judgment
as an investigator is further proved by the fact that he
admitted that many of the tests he proposed were rejected
by the mediums he was investigating. Such conditions
made the test impossible and he did not seem to realize
it, but notwithstanding all this he is one of the most
quoted authorities in Spiritualistic realms, particularly by
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

<p>Another who was misled by the chicanery of mediums
which he investigated during many years of research is Sir
Oliver Lodge. He failed to find sufficient evidence to
prompt him to spread the teachings of Spiritualism until
1904, after which he occasionally sent a “glow through
the Spiritualistic world by some bold profession of belief.”
In 1905 he was not quite ready to endorse but strongly
commended mediums. But by 1916 he had become “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
great scientist of the movement, the link between the
popular belief and scientific theory.” It is extremely
difficult, however, to understand how a leading scientist
can permit his pen to lay before a thinking world such
inconsistent impossibilities as the following:</p>

<p>“A table can exhibit hesitation, it can seek for information,
it can welcome a newcomer, it can indicate joy
or sorrow, fun or gravity, it can keep time with a song
as if joining in the chorus and most notably of all it
can exhibit affection in an unmistakable manner.”</p>

<p><em>What has all this to do with the spirit of the departed?</em>
How is it possible to accept such silly nonsense? Think
of it! A <em>table</em> with intelligence, brains—a <em>table</em> with
consciousness—a <em>table</em> with emotion. Yet that is the sort
of reasoning used by Sir Oliver in his book “Raymond”
and it is acceptable to all enthusiastic advocates
of occult teaching. When we read of a mind of such
high culture being overcome by such misfortune we are
moved to compassion rather than censure and can only
conjecture that the loss of his beloved son, Raymond, in
an accursed war was the cause of it.</p>

<p>Margaret Deland wrote:</p>

<p>“As for the scientific value of the evidence submitted
by Sir Oliver, one must not lose sight of the fact that by
far the greater part of it is from the experience of others
and accepted by him as established facts, in many cases
with little or no investigation as applied to telepathy.
By following his career, one familiar with the psychology
of deception will see that he has been an exceptionally
‘easy mark.’”</p>

<p>In describing a private performance of what is known
among magicians as “long-distance second-sight,” after
detailing the tests in full, Sir Oliver writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>“As regards collusion and trickery, no one who has
witnessed the absolutely genuine and artless manner in
which the impressions are described, but has been perfectly
convinced of the transparent honesty of all
concerned.</p>

<p>“This, however, is not evidence to those who have not
been present, and to them I can only say that to the
best of my scientific belief, no collusion or trickery was
possible under the varied circumstances of the
experiments.”</p>

<p>From the above, the reader may form his own opinion
as to the value of Sir Oliver Lodge’s investigation, and
at the same time should bear in mind that his so-called
investigation is typical of all the investigations by
scientists and sages who have accepted Spiritualism as a
fact or a religion (?).</p>

<p>The remaining figure of this type most conspicuously
in the spotlight on the Spiritualistic stage at the present
time is my esteemed friend, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Very much like Sir Oliver, his opinion hung in the balance
during many years of <em>investigation</em>, some thirty or
thirty-five, and it is significant that he did not manifest
his deep concern in the cult until he too, like Sir Oliver,
had lost a son in the late war and his heartstrings had been
wrung by a similar grief.</p>

<p>In “The New Revelation,” which was written after he
had lost his son, he tells us that for thirty years he had
studied the subject of Spiritualism “<em>carelessly</em>,” <em>then
suddenly in a crisis of emotion</em>,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> he sees a possible balm
in it, but instead of realizing that this was, or should be,
the time for real investigation, he threw up his hands
with the cry:</p>

<p><em>“The objective side of it ceased to interest, for having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
made up one’s mind that it was true there was an end of
the matter.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>It is evident from his own confession that he decided
to accept Spiritualism regardless of any real revelation
that might present itself at a future time and the fact
that he did cease intelligent investigation is proved by
his own published statements quoted below.</p>

<p>In a letter in the <cite>New York Evening Mail</cite>, Dec. 29,
1921, he says:</p>

<p>“<em>I don’t need scientific proof of what I hear with my
own ears, see with my own eyes. Nobody does. This is
one of the fine things about Spiritualism. Each person
can prove it for himself. It proves immortality and the
better you live here, the further you’ll go there, progressing
finally to the perfect state.</em>”</p>

<p>In the <cite>New York World</cite>, June 22, 1922, he says:</p>

<p>“<em>That mediums I have recommended have been convicted
of fraud; any medium may be convicted, because
the mere fact of being a medium is illegal by our benighted
laws, but no medium I have ever recommended
has been shown to be fraudulent in a sense which would
be accepted by any real psychic student.</em><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> <em>This same
applies I believe to mediums recommended by Sir Oliver
Lodge.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>In connection with his corroboration of Sir Oliver’s
opinion about mediums Sir Arthur is reported to have
said:</p>

<p><em>“Sir Oliver is too damn scientific.”</em></p>

<p>And the <cite>New York World</cite> of June 3rd, 1922, quotes
him as saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>“<em>Most mediums take their responsibilities very seriously
and view their work in a religious light. A temptation
to which several great mediums have succumbed is
that of drink. This comes about in a very natural way,
for overworking leaves them in a state of physical prostration
and the stimulus of alcohol affords a welcome relief
and may tend at last to become a custom and finally a
curse.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Alcoholism always weakens the moral sense, so
that these degenerate mediums yield themselves more
readily to fraud. Tippling and moral degeneration are
by no means confined to psychics.</em></p>

<p>“<em>Far from being antagonistic to religion, this psychic
movement is destined to revivify religion. We come upon
what is sane, what is moderate, what is reasonable, what
is consistent with gradual evolution and the benevolence
of God. This new wave of inspiration has been sent into
the world by God.</em>”</p>

<p>I will not, at this time, dissect and analyze the above
statements, preferring to let the reader decide for himself
after reading them over carefully and digesting their
literal meaning. It is sufficient to direct attention to the
various contradictory statements and variance in the subjects
of law, morality, and religion, and their application
to the subject of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur is reported as saying that mediumship is
like an ear for music and might exist in “some vulgar
person,” but that the medium is only a carrier of messages
comparable to the boy who delivers telegrams.
From the foregoing excerpts of Sir Arthur’s own statements
it will be seen that he depends solely on his <em>senses</em>
of <em>seeing</em> and <em>hearing</em> (the two weakest and most easily
deceived) for his evidence. When once a medium has
his confidence he believes implicitly what the medium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
tells him, accepts their “hear-say evidence” as gospel
truth, notwithstanding that he admits they are possibly
of a vulgar, dishonest class, often addicted to alcoholism
to a degree of debauchery. It is extremely difficult to
harmonize these statements.</p>

<p>As to the sense of sight coupled to the sense of hearing:
while at Washington, D. C., Sir Arthur had a
“sitting” with the Zancigs and after witnessing phenomena
at their expert hands and minds, he gave them
a letter of which the following is a transcript:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have tested Professor and Mrs. Zancig to-day and
am quite assured that their remarkable performance, as
I saw it, was due to psychic causes (thought transference)
and not to trickery.</p>

<p class="sigright">
(Signed)   “Arthur Conan Doyle.”
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jules Zancig is a magician, a member of the Society
of American Magicians of which I have been the
President for the past seven years. I believe he is one
of the greatest second-sight artists that magical history
records. In my researches for the past quarter of a century
I have failed to trace anyone his superior. His
system seems to be supreme. He never at any time
claimed telepathy and as he has not, to my knowledge,
obtained money by pretending telepathy or spirit presentations,
it would not be fair to disclose his methods despite
the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle put the stamp of
genuineness on his work. Undoubtedly it <em>appeared</em> unfathomable
to Sir Arthur and he therefore concluded
that it was psychic and that there could be no other
solution.</p>

<p>Mal-observation is responsible for a lot of misunderstanding,
consequently misrepresentation, and as a result
much investigation is rendered valueless. Such misrepresentation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
is not intended to deceive but is an honest
expression of a conviction based on supposed facts by
persons unaware that they are victims of illusion. One
of the most, if not the most, flagrant instances of mal-observation
I have ever known of is told of in a book by
J. Hewat McKenzie, President of the British College of
Psychic Science, entitled “Spirit Intercourse.” On page
107 he says:</p>

<p>“Houdini, called the ‘Handcuff King,’ who has so ably
demonstrated his powers upon public-hall platforms is
enabled by psychic power (though this he does not advertise),
to open lock, handcuff, or bolt that is submitted to
him. He has been imprisoned within heavily barred
cells, doubly and trebly locked, and from them all he
escaped with ease. This ability to unbolt locked doors is
undoubtedly due to his mediumistic powers, and not to
any normal mechanical operation on the lock. The force
necessary to shoot a bolt within a lock is drawn from
Houdini the medium, but it must not be thought that this
is the only means by which he can escape from his prison,
for at times his body has been dematerialized and withdrawn,
but this will be treated in another part of this
chapter.”</p>

<p>As I am the one most deeply concerned in this charge
I am also the best equipped to deny such erroneous statements.
I do claim to free myself from the restraint of
fetters and confinement, but positively state that I accomplish
my purpose purely by physical, not psychical
means. The force necessary to “shoot a bolt within a
lock,” is drawn from Houdini the living human being and
not a medium. My methods are perfectly natural, resting
on natural laws of physics. I do not <em>dematerialize</em> or
<em>materialize</em> anything; I simply control and manipulate
material things in a manner perfectly well understood by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
myself, and thoroughly accountable for and equally understandable
(if not duplicable) by any person to whom
I may elect to divulge my secrets. But I hope to carry
these secrets to the grave as they are of no material benefit
to mankind, and if they should be used by dishonest persons
they might become a serious detriment.</p>

<p>On page 112 of his book Mr. McKenzie again refers to
me saying:</p>

<p>“Houdini of world wide fame, previously mentioned,
has for years demonstrated dematerialization, and the passage
of matter through matter upon the public platform,
while Mrs. Thompson of America, has demonstrated materialization.
Mrs. Zancig has, with her husband, publicly
exhibited her psychic gift, called ‘thought transference,’
which is purely soul projection, in all the leading
world centres. Miss Fay, and several well known Japanese
mediums, for years demonstrated the passage of
matter through matter, and also materialization. These
are only a few of the many who might be mentioned, who
demonstrate psychic gifts before the public. Such public
mediums do not, of course, advertise themselves as performing
their wonders by occult powers, or through the
help of spirits, and the public are therefore left in ignorance
of how they perform their marvelous tricks, as they
are called. The author has tested each of those mentioned,
by a personal experiment from the stage, and several
also in private, and can testify that they are mediums,
performing most, if not all of their great wonders by
spirit agency. They are naturally reluctant to acknowledge
the fact, for the music-hall public would instantly
resent any claims they might make that they performed
their wonders by spirit power. Their audiences would regard
such claims as ‘bunkum,’ and probably subject them
to insult, if not to ill treatment, for the general public are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
entirely ignorant of such possibilities in the manipulation
of psychical matter as related in this book, which a
medium can develop with the co-operation of spirit entities.
It can be left to the reader’s imagination to picture
the face of a music-hall manager if he were asked to
allow upon the stage a demonstration of spirit powers.
Horrors! The poor man would not be able to sleep for
nights if he thought ghosts were working around his buildings
or upon his stage. Thus, knowing the attitude of
men toward such things these wonders of wonders are
produced upon the music-hall stage as clever ‘mystery’
tricks. The author does not wish his readers to suppose
that the mechanical sleight-of-hand tricks carried out by
Maskelyne and Devant and similar operators, have anything
to do with the mediumistic gift, for they are a
mechanical copy of true magic. These tricks are performed
with tons of machinery, whereas the genuine
medium can produce his wonders, if necessary, naked and
in an empty room.</p>

<p>“The last occasion on which the author, under strict
test conditions saw Houdini demonstrate his powers of
dematerialization, was before thousands, upon the public
stage of the Grand Theatre, Islington, London. Here a
small iron tank, filled with water, was deposited upon the
stage, and in it Houdini was placed, the water completely
covering his body. Over this was placed an iron lid with
three hasps and staples, and these were securely locked.
The body was then completely dematerialized within this
tank within one and a half minutes, while the author stood
immediately over it. Without disturbing any of the locks,
Houdini was transferred from the tank direct to the back
of the stage in a dematerialized state. He was there
materialized, and returned to the stage front, dripping
with water, and attired in the blue jersey suit in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
entered the tank. From the time that he entered it to his
appearance on the stage only one and a half minutes had
expired. While the author stood adjacent to the tank,
during the dematerialization process, a great loss of physical
energy was felt by him, such as is usually experienced
by sitters in materializing seances, who have a good stock
of vital energy, as in such phenomena, a large amount of
energy is required. Dematerialization is performed by
methods similar in operation to those in which the psycho-plastic
essence is drawn from the medium. The body of
the medium may be reduced to half its ordinary weight
in the materializing room, but in the case of dematerialization
the essence continues to be drawn until the whole
physical body vanishes, and the substance composing it is
held in suspension within the atmosphere, much in the
same way as moisture is held by evaporation. While in
this state, Houdini was transferred from the stage to the
retiring room behind, and there almost instantaneously materialized.
The speed with which this dematerialization
was performed is much more rapid than is possible in the
materializing seance room, where time is required for the
essence to be crystallized into psycho-plastic matter. Not
only was Houdini’s body dematerialized, but it was carried
through the locked iron tank, thus demonstrating the passage
of matter through matter. This startling manifestation
of one of nature’s profoundest miracles was probably
regarded by most of the audience as a very clever trick.”</p>

<p>With the indulgence of the reader, I may be pardoned
perhaps, if I insist that it is just what I claim it to be—<em>simply
a superior trick</em>. The effect is original with me
and was invented in the course of my professional career
as a public entertainer, for the sole purpose of <em>entertaining</em>
audiences by mystifying them. My success seems to
be attested by Mr. McKenzie in his acknowledgment that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
he was deceived into the belief as to my mediumistic powers;
that I dematerialized my body and material substance,
and materialized these things, so restoring them to a
normal condition.</p>

<p>In rebuttal of this misconception I can only say that it
is a demonstration of mal-observation; there was nothing
supernatural in my performance. If I really possessed
such abnormal powers as Mr. McKenzie credits me with,
I should be only too ready to prove it for the enlightenment
of a waiting world. I disagree with Mr. McKenzie
that such acknowledgment would displease the “music-hall”
or theatrical managers; on the contrary I am sure
they would gladly open their stages to the demonstration
and regard it as good management and showmanship. As
to the performance of Mrs. Thompson of America, and
Miss Fay their work is no more psychic than mine. It
is simply another phase of magical deception, and I stand
ready to reproduce such performances in an emergency.</p>

<p>Regarding the personally conducted tests of my work,
by Mr. McKenzie, he did no more or less than all my
committees are privileged to do while on the stage during
my acts. Just as all Spiritualist believers do, so Mr.
McKenzie relied on what he <em>thought</em> he saw, and therefore
failed to affirm or negative his misguided and misdirected
vision by rational application of his conscious
intelligence. Had he brought his reasoning faculties to
bear, as all sincere, unbiased investigators should, he
would have discovered the utter inconsistency of his deductions
and never have gone on record as the author of
such folly, without a particle of real evidence with which
to substantiate his claim.</p>

<p>Dr. Crawford, whose life was devoted to scientific pursuit
and research, gave the last three years of his life to
<em>investigating</em> occult or psychic phenomena, and failed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
utterly. His mind became impaired and he ended his own
life by suicide, acknowledging that his brain was overtaxed
with abstruse problems. He was so completely nonplussed
and befuddled by the tricks of the Goligher family,
that he gave them publicity as being genuine mediums;
and the unfortunate man died without discovering his own
weakness and error. Had he retained his mental balance
a year or two longer, he would have been disillusioned
by his co-worker in science, my friend Mr. E. E. Fournier
d’Albe, the result of whose investigation is to be found
elsewhere in this volume.</p>

<p>The unsuccessful investigations of those I have referred
to are typical of all I have come in contact with or have
learned of, and the barrier to their success has been their
perfect willingness to be deceived. They agree to and
tolerate the most absurd propositions as to the conditions
under which the so-called investigations are conducted;
just as they are <em>fixed</em> by the mediums themselves. They
acquiesce in and assist the medium to produce results, and
accept such results as conclusive evidence of the supernatural.</p>

<p>What does it all mean?</p>

<p>What importance can be attached to any one of these
supposed phenomena as proof of the return of departed
spirits?</p>

<span class="subhead">HOW MEDIUMS OBTAIN INFORMATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> read in the newspapers of some payroll bandit who
holds up the paymaster of a big concern and steals thousands
of dollars, or of burglars entering homes and stores
and breaking open safes and taking valuable loot, but
these cases which we read of are nothing in comparison
to some of the news which never reaches our ears, news of
mediums who, because resourceful in obtaining information
have made millions of dollars; blood money made at
the cost of torture to the souls of their victims.</p>

<p>Suppose a medium comes to your town. He advertises
a private seance. Like the average person you are curious
and wish to be told things about yourself which you
honestly believe no one in the world knows not even
your most intimate friend. Perhaps you would like to
learn some facts about a business deal, or know what is
to be the outcome of a love affair, or it may be that you
seek the comfort and solace that one is hungry for after
the death of a near one. You go to this medium and are
astounded by the things which are told you about yourself.</p>

<p>I do not claim that I can explain all the methods used
by mediums to obtain this knowledge. A reader might
attend a seance where the medium would use altogether
different means to get the facts, but I am familiar with a
great many of the methods of these human vultures. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
think though that it is an insult to that scavenger of scavengers
to compare such human beings to him but there is,
to my mind, no other fit comparison.</p>

<p>The stock-in-trade of these frauds is the amount of
knowledge they can obtain. It is invaluable and they
will stop at nothing to gain it. They will tabulate the
death notices in the newspapers; index the births and
follow up the engagement and marriage notices; employ
young men to attend social affairs and mix intimately with
the guests, particularly the women.</p>

<p>It is seldom that one of these mediums will see a person
the day he calls but will postpone the seance from a day
or two to a week or more. As the person leaves the building
he is followed by one of the medium’s confederates
who gathers enough information about him to make the
medium’s powers convincing when the seance is held.</p>

<p>It is a common occurrence for mediums of this stamp
to hunt through the court records of property and mortgages.
Cases have been known where they have employed
men to read proof sheets in the press rooms of
newspapers to find material with which to “foretell” events
at seances. They frequently tap telephone wires. It is
customary for these mediums to search letter boxes, steam
open the letters, and make copies for future use. They
have been known to buy the old letters sold to paper
mills by big concerns, one useful letter, out of a ton of
rubbish, being enough to pay them a great profit. It is
also a common thing for mediums to “plant” assistants as
waiters in restaurants for the purpose of overhearing
conversation, especially in restaurants of the better class,
business clubs, and luncheon clubs, where men of note
freely discuss their plans and secrets, and in the “gilded
lobster palaces” of Broadway and many hotel cabarets
in other towns there are men who check and tabulate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
good spenders and who in one way or another, usually
when the victims are under the influence of drink, get
into their confidence and secure information which is sold
for money.</p>

<p>My attention was called to a case where it was said that
a medium “planted” clerks in a Metropolitan hotel who
would open, read, and re-seal the letters of guests. The
medium was also able to get girls at the switchboard who
intercepted messages and made a typewritten record of
telephone conversations for him.</p>

<p>In many apartment houses the elevator boys, superintendents
and servants are bribed to make a daily report
of the inside happenings of the house. Most of the mediums
work in the dark and many of them have employed
expert pickpockets who cleverly take from the sitters’
pockets letters, names, memorandums, etc., while they
are being interviewed. These are passed to the medium
who tells the sitter more or less of their contents. Having
served their purpose they are returned to the pockets of
the sitter who, none the wiser, goes out to help spread
reports of the medium’s wonderful ability. Mediums’
campaigns are planned a long time ahead. They make
trips on steamers gathering, tabulating and indexing for
future reference the information to be overheard in the
intimate stories and morsels of scandals exchanged in the
smoking rooms, card rooms, and ladies’ salons.</p>

<p>A man in a confidential moment told some very
intimate secrets of his business to a chance traveling acquaintance
while they sat in the smoking compartment
of a Pullman car. Unfortunately for him this acquaintance
belonged to an unscrupulous gang of mediums who
used the information to blackmail him. These gangs of
clairvoyant blackmailers will stop at nothing. They will
move into the apartment house in which their victim lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
and watch his habits. When sure of ample time they
will break into his rooms, not to steal valuables, but information
which nets them far more than the small amount
of diamonds and cash which they might snatch. If it
is possible to steal the records of great political parties
how much easier to steal the secret papers of a family.
If you doubt that information leaks out look up some of
the cases that have been brought to the attention of the
courts; cases where papers from secret organizations were
missing; where the most intimate documents have been
given publicity. Such information is far more difficult to
obtain than the records of the dead. The Bar Association
protects its reputation by weeding out lawyers who prey
on clients but it cannot so easily discover a dishonest
employee in a lawyer’s office who takes advantage of information
which he knows to be sacred and secret.</p>

<p>Mediums are especially desirous of keeping in touch
with disgruntled employees. There is no limit to what
they will do. They have been known to arrange for the
employment of accomplices as domestics and chauffeurs in
families where they were particularly anxious to get information
and have frequently had dictagraphs placed in
homes by fake or disloyal servants and after a month or so
of tabulating secrets and information were prepared for a
seance at which the sitters could only account for the
amazing things told them by believing the medium had
occult aid. The result was an unqualified confidence in
the mediumistic powers which in the end cost the sitters
an exorbitant sum.</p>

<p>I heard of a medium who employed a quiet couple for
the express purpose of attending funerals, mixing with
the mourners, and gathering information which was eventually
turned into gold, and what is known as a “sure-fire”
method is to dress some little woman demurely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
place her in the reception room where she greets the visitors,
telling them her troubles and naturally receiving their
confidences in return.</p>

<p>I have even known of two cases in which these human
wolves, apparently out of the kindness of their hearts,
sent girls to a young ladies’ seminary where they were
able to wheedle from their roommates secrets which caused
the loss of several fortunes.</p>

<p>One of the biggest scoops and one that is talked of
in hushed tones even among the fraud fraternity is that of
an old-time circus grafter who, having been cleaned out
in Wall Street, was at his wits’ ends to make a living. One
evening, tired and weary from a day’s unsuccessful efforts
to find honest employment, he overheard his two daughters
discussing a bit of scandal they had listened to in the
hairdressing parlor where they were employed and which
compromised a prominent society woman’s name. The
old man pricked up his ears, recognized the possibilities,
and a very short time after invested what little capital he
had and all he could borrow in a beauty parlor and with
the information it furnished him through the aid of his
wife and daughters he was able to set himself up as
a medium, the venture yielding handsomely the first
year.</p>

<p>A most novel method of obtaining information was devised
by a man who decided after listening to the conversation
in a Turkish bath to open one himself. Most of
his attendants were accomplices and while the patrons
were enjoying the bath their clothes were searched, letters
opened and signatures traced. The end of the first
year found him enjoying a country home in an aristocratic
neighborhood.</p>

<p>During one of my engagements in Berlin, Germany, I
made the acquaintance of the foreman of a safe factory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
who told me that he made a duplicate key<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> for every safe
which passed through his hands and that he sold these
keys to mediums but with the express understanding that
there should be nothing stolen. The mediums assured
him that all they wanted was an opportunity to read the
mail and private papers which the safes contained.</p>

<p>I have known of a number of cases in which the medium
used a drug addict to secure information giving the
poor tortured creature his necessary drug only in return
for facts he wanted, knowing that when the addict was
suffering for the drug’s stimulus he would stop at nothing
to secure it.</p>

<p>In small towns “Bible sellers” have sometimes been
employed who were able to get exact dates, names, and
birth places which were eventually used in some form.
Men employed by mediums to gather information are
often disguised as agents. One in particular I know of
who goes from house to house trying to sell typewriters
and washing machines on the installment plan. Even if
he does not make a sale he can at least engage the lady
of the house in conversation, drawing on her sympathy by
telling of the trials and tribulations of a canvasser and a
pitiful tale of how he was driven to such work and in
return usually receiving the particulars of some similar
case among her friends or relatives. Information which
is carefully saved for use in the future.</p>

<p>It has been necessary for the United States Government
to assign special men to break up a band of fake census
enumerators, which, going from neighborhood to neighborhood,
secures complete family histories which are later
sold to mediums for large sums of money.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting cases I have heard of lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
is that of a young man who was greatly in debt and sought
the advice of a medium. The medium offered to pay his
debts if he in return would take a position which the medium
would secure for him in the Bureau of Records and
in addition to his work furnish the medium with copies of
certain documents. Fear of his debts becoming known
to his parents forced him to accept the offer and the
medium got the desired data but before an improper use
could be made of it the young man’s conscience led him
to make a clean breast of the whole affair to the police
and a gigantic fraud was “nipped in the bud.”</p>

<p>The most dastardly and unscrupulous methods that I
ever heard of, methods almost beyond belief, were those
used by a medium who made arrangements with a ring of
“white slavers” by which he paid them a certain specified
sum for any information which the “girls” in their
“houses” were able to secure. In addition he also established
a number of places where, under the direction of a
woman, the girls drew out many secrets which would
never have been told under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>One thing which makes the work of these mediums
easier is the fact that many people tell things about themselves
without realizing it. I have known people to deny
emphatically that they had made certain statements or
mentioned certain things in a seance although I had personally
heard them say those very things not more than
twenty minutes before. Under the excitement of the moment
their subconscious mind<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> speaks while their conscious
mind forgets. This does not escape the medium
who takes advantage of everything which it is possible to.</p>

<p>An incident related to me by the late Harry Kellar
shows in a striking way what can be done with information
the possession of which is not suspected nor its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
source accounted for by the victim. He had met in Hong
Kong a troupe of travelling players, known as the “Loftus
Troupe” which was featuring Jefferson De Angelus.
Among these players was one, Jim Mass, who, during a
discussion of Spiritualism scoffed at anyone’s belief in it.
Kellar told him to visit his hotel the following night and
he would be given a seance. Mass did and Kellar pretended
to go into a deep trance rolling his eyes and imitating
all the other effects. While in the trance he told Mass
his history from the time he ran away from Newark, N. J.,
relating his trials and tribulations and his efforts to make
a success on the stage up to the time when a young lady
committed suicide in San Francisco because of his jealousy.
Then Kellar turned to him and said:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Jim Mass,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“That is not your right name,” Kellar retorted, “your
right name is James Cropsey!”</p>

<p>“It is a lie,” said Mass.</p>

<p>“No, it is not a lie, for I see before me your name. I
see that your father has just died of a broken heart because
of your behaviour. I see your mother writing you
a letter to that effect, begging you to come home and
be her son again. I see the grave of your father and on
the tombstone is inscribed, ‘James Cropsey.’”</p>

<p>Kellar came out of the trance and Mass sprang up
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“My God, you have told me things that only the Almighty
and I know!”</p>

<p>Kellar claimed to Mass that he did not know anything
which had transpired in the trance. The following day a
letter came from Mass’ mother telling him of the death
of his father. This fully convinced him that Kellar had
strong mediumistic powers, and to such an extent that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
when they met a few days later and Kellar told him that
it was all a fake, Mass refused to believe it.</p>

<div id="i_224" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_224.jpg" width="1210" height="1217" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">KELLAR AND HOUDINI</div></div>

<p>Kellar explained to me that while in Manila a few
weeks previous he had met an American traveller who,
while they were discussing the different theatrical companies
in the Orient, had told him all the incidents he had
repeated to Mass in the supposed trance. This traveller
had written home to Mass’ mother telling her of her son’s
whereabouts and therefore Kellar felt fairly safe in saying
that a letter would arrive in a few days, but in spite of
Kellar’s confession Mass continued to believe firmly that
he was a genuine psychic.</p>

<p>Mediums have been known after gaining the sitter’s
confidence sufficiently, to advise, through a Spirit, the
purchase of certain stocks, bonds, or “swamp lands,” and
a certain group which I know has made over a million
dollars by this system. One of the keenest and most unscrupulous
of this class, a man who at present is abroad
waiting for things to blow over, had a method which
gained him a huge fortune. He would acquire the confidence
of a widow whose husband had not been dead long
and for months he would search into her private affairs
without her knowledge. Then he would arrange for a
meeting with her at which he would mention casually that
he was a Spiritualist and that she could find solace and
comfort in Spiritualism. At an impromptu seance he
would tell her so many things of a most intimate character
that she would be convinced. After a series of
seances he would materialize and manifest what was supposedly
the Spirit of her husband who would tell her to
turn over certain property and deeds to this medium who
would take care of them in a business-like manner. Invariably
the poor deluded widow would surrender to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
machinations and that would be the last she would ever
hear of medium or money.</p>

<p>At a time when it was a British society fad to delve into
the affairs of the beyond a house of clairvoyance was
opened in London’s most exclusive section, the fashionable
West End. It was exquisitely furnished and the interior
decorating was the show work of a well-known firm.
Though known as “Madame ——” the proprietor was
in reality the daughter of an English aristocrat. She had
formed a partnership with a man known to society as “Sir
——” and thought of as being simply a “man about
town,” but was in reality the head of a desperate band of
the underworld.</p>

<p>A rich clientele soon became accustomed to a rule which
required sittings to be arranged for at least a week in advance
which gave Madame —— plenty of time for her
confederates to investigate the client’s affairs. After
several sittings the Madame would tell her client that she
was exhausted but could reveal more if allowed to enter
the atmosphere of the home and come in personal contact
with some of the intimate belongings of the client. This
hint invariably secured the desired invitation. Once a
guest in the client’s home, she went from room to
room selecting various things and finally suggesting,
at the psychological moment, that she be shown all
of the client’s jewelry. While this was being brought
out Madame —— supposedly went into a trance
but was in reality watching closely to see where the
jewelry was kept. Back in her own home again she
at once got in touch with Sir —— giving him such
detailed information about the client’s house that it was
easy for him to plan its successful robbery by his men,
while the victims never suspected how their secret hiding
places had been discovered. It only took the pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
five years to acquire a fortune of three million dollars
by these methods. Then Scotland Yard became suspicious
of their actions and in a search for a more congenial
climate they came to America and began working their
system in New York.</p>

<p>Sir —— learned through underworld channels
of a rich eccentric who would have nothing to do with
banks and safe deposit vaults but kept all his money
and valuables in his home where he boasted so many burglar
alarms and other protective devices as to practically
dare thieves to rob him. After making sure that this man
had very strong Spiritualistic tendencies Madame ——
wrote him a letter in which she told him that she had been
requested by the spirit of his dead brother to get into
communication with him. An interview followed and
then a seance at which the brother’s spirit was claimed to
have been materialized. The man was so convinced that
he had received a message from his brother that the instructions
to safeguard his money and valuables by placing
them in a certain bank were followed implicitly even to
the extent of taking them to the president (?) of the bank
at his home instead of going to the bank with them. It is
needless to say that the “bank president” was none other
than Sir ——. This exploit netted them about four
hundred thousand dollars. Not long after they appeared
in Paris. Madame —— proceeded to dupe a jeweler
out of a quantity of valuable jewels and with Sir ——
succeeded in escaping to Germany where they tried to
repeat the performance but were arrested.</p>

<p>The majority of the people who are fleeced do not blame
the medium but really believe that the Spirit of their departed
one prescribed the loss and that the medium simply
acted as an agent. It is only when the mediums fall out;
when there ceases to be “honor among thieves” that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
cases are brought to the attention of the police. Although
I realize that it would be difficult to enforce, there should
be a law to prevent these frauds, for as the result of investigation
I know that this particular line has netted
many millions of dollars from unwary, trusting, and believing
people. An end ought to be put to it.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT YOU MUST BELIEVE TO BE A
SPIRITUALIST</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is an old adage that “truth is stranger than
fiction” but some of the miraculous things attributed to
the Spirits would not be told, could not be told, even by
such a famous writer of wild fiction as Baron Munchausen,
but under the protecting mantle of Spiritualism these vivid
tales are believed by millions. The conglomerated things
you are asked to accept in good faith are almost inconceivable.
If you do not then you are not a real Spiritualist.
There must not be the shadow of a doubt in your
mind as to the truth of the extravagant feats claimed to
be performed by the Spirits through their earthly messengers
the mediums.</p>

<p>Among the spirits who have come back and written
stories, according to the Spiritualists, are no less personages
than Shakespeare, Bacon, Charles Dickens who completed
his “Mystery of Edwin Drood,” Jack London,
Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, and lately Oscar Wilde.
Magazines have been published by the “Spirits”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and
there are numbers of cases where entire books have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
claimed to be their work. I ask the reader if he believes
the following incidents which I have selected from various
Spiritualistic publications in my library. If so he is
entitled to join the cult.</p>

<p>The “Medium and Daybreak” of June 9, 1871, tells
of an instance where “The Spirits ‘floated’ Mr. Herne to
Mrs. Guppy’s in open day as was reported by us two
weeks ago.... This has been speedily followed by
other cases some of which are exceedingly well substantiated.
On Saturday evening, as a circle consisting of
about nine persons, sat within locked doors, with Messrs.
Herne and Williams, at these mediums’ lodgings, 61
Lambs’ Conduit Street, after a considerable time an object
was felt to come upon the table, and when a light was
struck, their visitor was found to be Mrs. Guppy. She
was not by any means dressed for an excursion, as she
was without shoes, and had a memorandum book in one
hand and a pen in the other.</p>

<p>“The last word inscribed in the book was ‘onions.’ The
writing was not yet dry and there was ink on the pen.
When Mrs. Guppy regained her consciousness she stated
that she had been making some entries of expenses, became
insensible and knew nothing until she found herself
in the circle. A party of gentlemen accompanied Mrs.
Guppy home; a deputation went in first and questioned
Miss Neyland as to how or when Mrs. Guppy had been
missed. She said that she had been sitting in the same
room; Mrs. Guppy was making entries in her book, and
Miss Neyland was reminding her of the items to put down.
Miss Neyland was reading a newspaper in the intervals
of conversation, and when she raised her head from her
reading Mrs. Guppy could not be seen. It was intimated,
through raps on the table, that the Spirits had taken her,
and as Mrs. Guppy had every confidence in the beneficence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
of these agents, Mrs. Guppy’s abduction gave no concern.
Both Mr. Herne and Mr. Williams were ‘floated’
the same evening. Mr. Williams found himself at the
top of the stairs, the doors being shut all the while.</p>

<p>“At the seance at the Spiritual Institution, a young lady
who was a sceptic was levitated. At Messrs. Herne and
Williams’ seance, at the same place, a geranium in a pot
was brought into the room from the staircase window
above, while doors and windows were closed. Mrs. Burns
had a knife taken out of her hand, which ‘Katie’ (the
Spirit) said she would deposit at Lizzie’s, meaning Mrs.
Guppy. A gentleman had two spirit photographs taken
from his hand. A cushion was carried from the front
room to the back room, where the seance was held, the
door being shut. Mr. Williams’ coat was taken off while
his hands were held. Mr. Herne was floated. Mr. Andrews,
a gentleman who has not the use of his limbs,
held a very interesting conversation with ‘Katie’ who
promised to try and benefit him. The generous sympathy
of these good spirits was very apparent from their eagerness
to help the distressed. A letter from Northampton
intimates that similar phenomena are being produced in
that town. These feats are doing a mighty work in convincing
hundreds of the power.</p>

<p>“At a seance given by Mrs. Guppy (‘Medium and Daybreak,’
November 18, 1870), the Spirits knowing it was
tea time, first of all brought through the solid wall the
dishes and placed them on the table, then transported
cake and hot tea, and in the center of the table was placed
violets, mignonette, geranium leaves and fern leaves,
all wet with rain, which had been gathered by the
Spirits.</p>

<p>“Herne, with whom Williams was associated, made it
his business to have his Spirits bring in the slates from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the hallway through the closed door. He had books ooze
through the solid floors, from the library overhead, and
drop on the seance table. Williams would be entranced
in the cabinet and the Spirits would disrobe him much
to his ‘entranced’ embarrassment.</p>

<p>On the testimony of Orville Pitcher, John King at a
seance stood in the full glare of the daylight for twenty
minutes. He then retired and was followed by no less a
personage than Oliver Cromwell, who walked around,
embraced his medium and all the sitters. He afterwards
controlled the medium and gave utterance to thoughts of
a most elevated nature.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Catherine Berry goes on record (‘Medium and
Daybreak,’ July 9, 1876) that through the mediumship of
Mrs. Guppy she had seen the Sultan of Zanzibar on the
previous day. “He had a handsome copper-colored face
and a large black beard, on his head he had a white turban
such as worn by the Spirit of John King.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Monck, ex-preacher, disappeared one night from
the bed in which he slept with another man in Bristol and
to his surprise, when he awoke, found himself in Swindon.”
(<em>Spiritualism</em>, by Joseph McCabe.)</p>

<p>“Mr. Harris, his wife and a friend, who happened to be
a medium, were just about to sit down to a mid-day meal
when the medium, a man named Wilkinson, was suddenly
‘controlled.’ He fought hard against this unexpected
behaviour of his Spirit control, but to no avail. In his
unconscious state he jangled money in his pocket, then
pointed to a cigarette box which was lying on a shelf in
the opposite corner. In that box, it seemed, was the sum
of 17s, 6d. Mr. and Mrs. Harris were wondering what
this all meant, when suddenly the box virtually flew from
the shelf, passed through the closed door, and was gone.
Mrs. Harris immediately left the room and tried to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
trace of the box. SHE FOUND IT UPSTAIRS UNDERNEATH
THE PILLOW ON THE BED. The money
was intact.” (<cite>An Amazing Seance and an Exposure</cite>, <i>by</i>
Sidney A. Mosley, page 21.)</p>

<p>At a seance held on February 15, 1919, at the home of
Mr. Wallace Penylan at Cardiff, by Mr. Thomas, there
were present Sir Arthur, Lady Doyle, and others, numbering
about twenty in all. “Thomas, speaking from his
chair (apparently still under control) then asked, ‘Is Lady
Doyle cold?’ Then Lady Doyle said she felt ‘a little bit
shivery’ and Thomas said, ‘Oh, you’ll be warm soon,’
and in a second or two something fell on her lap. At the
close of the seance, this was found to be the Holland
jacket which somehow had been removed from the medium.”
(<cite>An Amazing Seance</cite>, page 51.)</p>

<p>Most mediums to-day have perfected the art of levitating
tables and chairs and other pieces of furniture, though I
doubt if any of them have ever reached the mark of perfection
attained by Palladino with her years of experience,
inscrutable face and uncanny knowing when to seize opportunities
to fool her investigators, but you are also asked
to believe that Daniel Dunglas Home, floated out of one
window, over the street, and rushed through another one
into a different room.</p>

<p>Col. Olcott asks in “Communication” What is this performance
compared with the experience of Webster Eddy
(a younger brother of the Eddy Brothers) when a grown
man, in the presence of three reputable witnesses, was
carried out of a window and over the top of a house and
landed in a ditch a quarter of a mile distant?</p>

<p>“William Eddy was carried bodily to a distant wood
and was kept there three days under control and was carried
back again.</p>

<p>“Horatio Eddy was taken bodily three miles to a mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
top and was obliged to find his way home alone the
next morning.</p>

<p>“In Lyceum Hall, Buffalo, Horatio was levitated for
twenty-six consecutive evenings, while bound to a chair
and he and the chair were hung on a chandelier hook in
the ceiling. He was then lowered safely to his former
position.</p>

<p>“Mary Eddy was raised to the ceiling in Hope Chapel,
in New York City, and while there wrote her name. Her
little boy, Warren, was floated many evenings in dark circles
and squealed lustily all the while to be let down.</p>

<p>“Since 1347 authenticated reports prove that similar
experiences occurred to Edward Irving, Margaret Rule,
St. Philip of Neri, St. Catherine of Columbine, Loyola,
Savonarola, Jennie Lord, Madame Hauffe and many
others.”</p>

<p>Col. Olcott omitted mentioning myself. I stand ready
to vouch for the fact that I personally floated in the air
and <em>levitated</em> many times and marvelled at the ease with
which I did it, but I woke up later in the night.</p>

<p>Horatio Eddy in a personal letter to me under date of
July 6, 1920, wrote:</p>

<p>“A book six inches thick would not hold my history. I
cannot give any version of our floating in the air, but it
is just as stated in ‘Communication.’ Webster Eddy is
my youngest brother. My father did put live coals on
William’s head and poured hot water down his back. We
all used to get horsewhipped by him to prove the devil
was in us.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>In another letter dated July 3, 1922, he writes that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
and his sister had been giving a joint exhibition with Ira
Erastus Davenport, who had been ordered by the authorities
in Syracuse to take out a juggler’s license, but would
not.</p>

<p>“The result was while we were holding a private seance
we were handcuffed and taken to jail; on the way the handcuffs
were taken off. We did not ride to jail but were
dragged along through the snow for more than a mile.
They did not put us in cells, as I told them if they did I
would have every prisoner’s door open before daylight,
so two police sat up all night with us. In the morning a
Mr. McDonald of 7 Beach Street went our bail for fifteen
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“Our trial was to be held in Schenectady in March. We
arrived there and had to wait three weeks, then they put
it over to Albany three months later and our bail was
renewed. We stayed in Albany until court was almost
through. The day our trial was to take place the judge
stated we claimed it to be a phase of religion and ruled
it out of court.”</p>

<p>If you are to be a Spiritualist you must believe that
fifteen persons, several of them reporters, met in Mrs.
Young’s parlors in 27th Street, New York City, and at
the request of the Spirit several English walnuts were
placed near the piano, and that the piano rose and descended
on the walnuts without crushing them. Col.
Olcott writes that seven of the heaviest persons in the
room were asked to sit upon the instrument. The invitation
being accepted Mrs. Young played a march and the
instrument and the persons surmounting it were lifted
several feet.</p>

<p>“A portfolio containing Eliza White’s Katie King note
and John’s duplicate was at this time in my coat pocket,
where it had been constantly since the preceding evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
John broke in upon our expressions of surprise by rapping
out ‘Do you folks want me to commit forgery for you?
I can bring you here the blank check of any National
Bank and sign upon it the name of any president, cashier
or other official.’ I thanked his Invisible Highness and declined
the favor upon the sufficient ground that the police
did not believe in Spiritualism and I did not care to risk
the chance of convincing them in case the forged papers
should be found in my possession.” (<cite>People from the
Other World</cite>, Henry S. Olcott, page 458.)</p>

<p>“In a house on Ferretstone Road, Hornsey, London,
explosions like bombs were heard, lumps of coal were propelled
by some unknown agency in all directions. Brooms
were thrown violently from a landing into the kitchen.
Glass and china had been smashed and windows broken
and to top it all off a boy sitting on a chair had been
raised with the chair from the ground.” (The <cite>London
Evening News</cite>, Feb. 15, 1921.)</p>

<p>Vincenzo Gullots, a Sicilian violinist at Batavia, Ill.,
well known by reason of his Chautauqua concerts, decided
to take a bride chosen for him after death “by the companion
of my most thrilling hours, my departed wife.
She died in August and I was almost frantic with grief but
in the night I could sense her presence and I followed
her guidance implicitly. My new mate will comfort her.”
(The <cite>New York World</cite>, May 17, 1922.)</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in an interview at the Hotel
Ambassador, New York City, as reported by the <cite>New
York World</cite>, April 11, 1922, stated that “in ‘Summerland’
marriage is on a higher and more spiritual plane
than here and is merely the mating of affinities, who are
always happy. No babies are born however. The spirits
as they go about their daily tasks, keep a watchful eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
on earthly matters and are extremely interested in the
births here.”</p>

<p>He stated that there is a plane called “Paradise” where
“normally respectable” persons go after death and this
“plane” is only slightly removed from this earthly sphere.
Bad people when they die are transported to a plane considerably
lower than that tenanted by respectable ones
and they continue to sink lower and lower unless they
repent. After a considerable probationary period they
are able to climb into “Paradise.” The average length of
time they stay in “Paradise” is about forty years after
which they float to higher and still higher planes. All
mediums have guardian angels to whom they are especially
subject, but they can communicate with other Spirits,
the “guardian angel” acting as a sort of master-of-ceremonies
upon such occasions.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur proclaimed that he once saw his dead
mother’s face in the ectoplasm of a medium. This was a
few months after her death and he added, “There was not
the slightest question about it. That was while I was in
Australia. The face seemed as solid as in life. My mother
wrote me a letter through the medium signing a pet name,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
which could not have been known to the medium. There
is no question about having been in communication with
my son either.”</p>

<p>An account in the <cite>New York American</cite>, April 5, 1923,
says that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle told the reporters that
he had recently hurt the ligaments in his right leg from
the shin to the thigh, and that his son Kingsley who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
died in the War had massaged the limb with beneficial
results: “I was sitting with Evan Powell, a very unusual
and powerful medium,” he said, “when my son Kingsley
appeared, saying ‘it will be alright, Daddy; I will get you
fixed up alright,’ and began massaging my leg.”</p>

<p>In an article in the <cite>London Magazine</cite>, August, 1920,
Mr. C. W. Leadbeater, a prominent member of the Theosophical
Society and an authority on occult theories,
speaking of the apport of Spirits says: “living astrally
as they do, the Fourth Dimension is a commonplace fact
of their nature, and this makes it quite simple for them
to do many little tricks which to us appear wonderful,
such as the removal of articles from a locked box or an
apport of flowers into a closed room.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his book “Wanderings of a
Spiritualist,” devotes seven pages to Charles Bailey, who
was known as an “apport medium.” Sir Arthur defends
Bailey, notwithstanding that he has been exposed many
times.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Among the things Bailey claims to have apported
are birds, oriental plants, small animals, and a young
shark eighteen inches long which he pretended the Spirit
guides had brought from India and passed through the
walls into the seance room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson of Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, told me
personally that the Spirit of her deceased son was very
mischievous at times and caused her a great deal of embarrassment.
One of his favorite jokes when she was on a
journey was to open her travelling bag and allow all
her belongings to be strewn about. She also told me
that the boy’s Spirit would light the fire for her to get
breakfast.</p>

<p>A widow in Brooklyn, N. Y., became a mother and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
claimed that the Spirit of her husband was the father of
the child.</p>

<p>The celebrated Professor Hare, a professor of chemistry
in the University of Pennsylvania, graduate of Yale and
Harvard, and associated with the Smithsonian Institute of
Washington, tells that when travelling with a boy and while
in his room, after they had locked up the iron Balled
Spiritscope, shaving case, etc., in his carpet bag, in some
inscrutable manner all the contents were taken from the
bag and fell about him in a shower.</p>

<p>Anna Stuart, a medium of Terre Haute, could produce
Spirits that would weigh from practically nothing to more
than a hundred pounds, and Spiritualists are expected to
believe that one human being can go into a trance and
bring forth three or four beings with his own Spirit form.
W. T. Stead, one of the most brilliant Spiritualists, now
dead, claimed to have seen the Spirit of an Egyptian who
left the “earthly life” in the time of Semir-Amide, three
thousand years ago. “For several minutes the Spirit was
distinctly visible to us munching an apple, but I felt so
exhausted by the loss of magnetism and nervous as well that
I begged him to leave us. I will never forget his soulful
expression.”</p>

<p>Florence Marryat, the daughter of Capt. Marryat, the
famous writer of sea stories, has written a number of
books on Spiritualism. She wrote one of the best introductions
in favor of Spiritualism that I ever read, nevertheless
some of the things she claims to have witnessed
and lived through are of such a nature that I will only give
a brief mention of them without comment, letting the
reader form his own opinion. They are taken from her
book “There is no Death.”</p>

<p>She tells of her brother-in-law coming into the room
after rifle practice and while showing his rifle it was “accidentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
discharged, the ball passing through the wall
within two inches of my eldest daughter’s head.” She
claims that she foresaw the occurrence the night previous.</p>

<p>She writes of having joined Mr. d-Oyley Carte’s “Patience”
company to play the part of Lady Jane, and tells
that the different members of the company on different
occasions mentioned the fact that although she was standing
on the stage she appeared to be seated in the stalls.
This always occurred at the same time, just before the
end of the second act.</p>

<p>In another place she says: “We unanimously asked for
flowers. It being December and a hard frost, simultaneously
we smelt the smell of fresh earth, and we were told
to light the gas again, when the following extraordinary
sight met our eyes. In the middle of the sitters, still
holding hands, was piled up on the carpet an immense
quantity of mold, which had been torn up apparently with
the roots that accompanied it. There were laurestenius,
laurels and holly and several others, just as they had been
pulled out of the earth and thrown in the midst of us.
Mrs. Guppy looked anything but pleased at the sight of
her carpet and begged the Spirits to bring cleaner things
next time. They then told us to extinguish the lights
again and each sitter was to wish mentally for something
for himself. I wished for a yellow butterfly, knowing it
was December, and as I thought of it a little cardboard box
was put in my hand. Prince Albert whispered to me
‘Have you got anything?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘but not what I
asked for. I expect they have given me a piece of jewelry.’
When the gas was relit I opened the box and there
lay <em>two yellow butterflies</em>, dead of course, but none the
less extraordinary for that.”</p>

<p>While talking of a seance with Katie King she said:
“She told me to take the scissors and cut off her hair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
She had a profusion of ringlets flowing to her waist that
night. I obeyed religiously, hacking the hair wherever
I could whilst she kept on saying ‘<em>Cut more! cut more! not
for yourself you know, because you cannot take it away.</em>’
So I cut off curl after curl and as fast as they fell to the
ground, <em>the hair grew again on her head</em>. When I had
finished, ‘Katie’ asked me to examine her hair and see if
I could detect any place where I had used the scissors,
and I did so without any effect. Neither was a severed
hair to be found. It had vanished out of sight.”</p>

<p>In another place she says: “Once a conductor spoke
to me. ‘I am not aware of your name,’ he said (and I
thought ‘No, my friend, and won’t be aware of it just yet
either!’) ‘but a Spirit here wishes you would come up to
the cabinet.’ I advanced, expecting to see some friend,
and there stood a Catholic priest, with his hand extended
in blessing. I knelt down and he gave me the usual
benediction, and then closed the curtain. ‘Did you know
the Spirit?’ the conductor asked me. I shook my head
and he continued, ‘He was Father Hayes, the well known
priest in this city. I suppose you are a Catholic?’ I
told him ‘Yes’ and went back to my seat. The conductor
addressed me again ‘I think Father Hayes must have come
to pave the way for some of your friends,’ he said. ‘Here
is a Spirit who says she has come for a lady by the name
of Florence, who has just crossed the sea. Do you answer
to that description?’ I was about to say yes when the
curtain parted again and my daughter ‘Florence’ ran
across the room and fell into my arms. ‘Mother,’ she exclaimed,
‘I said I would come with you and look after
you, didn’t I?’ I looked at her. She was exactly the same
in appearance as when she came to me in England under
the different mediumships of Florence Cook, Arthur Coleman,
Charles Williams and William Ellington.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>She tells of a business man who attended a seance
every night and presented a white flower to the Spirit of
his wife who had died on her wedding day eleven years
before.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> The book is full of such incidents as these but
I think enough have been repeated to show the reader
what it is necessary to believe to be a good Spiritualist.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>In Judge Edmonds’ book “Spiritualism,” we read
that it was customary to receive on blank sheets of paper
messages from the Spirits of well-known men; that Benjamin
Franklin came in accompanied by two other Spirits;
that a pencil got up of its own accord and wrote five lines
of ancient Hebrew; that books were levitated from a table
numerous times, and a number of other incidents which
drew upon the reader’s imagination.</p>

<p>Daniel Dunglas Home in testifying in July, 1869, as
reported in the <cite>London Times</cite>, told of an incident which
had occurred several years previous. “We were,” he said,
“in a large room in the Salon de Quatorze. The Emperor
and Empress were present,—I am now telling the story as
I heard the Emperor tell it,—a table was moved, then a
hand was seen to come. It was a very beautifully formed
hand. There were pencils on the table. It lifted, not the
one next to it, but the one on the far side. We heard the
sound of writing, and saw it writing on fine note paper.
The hand passed before me and went to the Emperor,
and he kissed the hand. It went to the Empress; she
withdrew from its touch, and the hand followed her. The
Emperor said, ‘Do not be frightened,’ and she kissed it too.
The hand seemed to be like a person thinking and as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
it were saying, ‘Why should I?’ It came back to me. It
had written the word ‘Napoleon’ and it remains written
now. The writing was the autograph of the Emperor
Napoleon I, who had an exceedingly beautiful hand.”
Mr. Home also said that the Emperor of Russia as well as
the Emperor Napoleon, had seen hands and had taken
hold of them, “when they seemed to float away into thin
air.”</p>

<p>Such are the things Spiritualists are expected to believe
and do believe. I could continue to recite incidents <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad
infinitum</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad nauseam</i>, but I believe the reader can form
his own judgment from the above. It is the kind of material
which drives people insane for when some poor,
sick, human being is just on the verge of recovery such
nonsensical utterances often overthrow reason. Is it any
wonder that the population of our insane asylums is
swelled with “followers” who have attempted to believe
these things?</p>

<span class="subhead">MAGICIANS AS DETECTORS OF FRAUD</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> alacrity with which Spiritualists seize upon letters
or other statements of magicians that they believe the
so-called spirit manifestations which they have witnessed
were not accomplished by means of legerdemain but were
attributable to supernatural or occult powers has astonished
me and while I intend to refute them I want to call attention
at the same time to the incompetence of the opinion
of the ordinary magician with a knowledge of two or three
experiments in Spiritualism who stands up and claims
that he can duplicate the experiments of any medium who
ever lived.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that notwithstanding the fact
that innumerable exposures have been successfully made,
such fact is no proof that any investigator, legerdemain
artist or otherwise, is fully capable of fathoming each and
every effect produced.</p>

<p>Some magicians with a knowledge of pseudo-Spiritualistic
effects imagine that they have all they need to qualify
them as investigators, and should anything transpire at a
seance which they cannot explain they are mystified
into temporary belief and write letters or make statements
which they are quite likely to regret as the years roll on.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>A good card “shark” or “brace game”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> gambler can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
cheat and fleece the slickest sleight-of-hand performer
that ever lived, unless the performer has made a specialty
of gambling tricks. It seems strange, but it is true, that
card magicians are poor gamblers, and mediums, like the
gamblers, resort to deception and take advantage of the
sitters at all angles.</p>

<p>It is manifestly impossible to detect and duplicate all
the feats attributed to fraudulent mediums who do not
scruple at outraging propriety and even decency to gain
their ends. A slick medium will even resort to drawing
on the sitters<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> for desired information by recourse to
what may be palmed off for a mere lark, and if the bait is
swallowed by the sitter the circumstance is turned to good
account for the perpetration of deliberate fraud to his consternation
and bewilderment.</p>

<p>Again many of the effects produced by mediums are
impulsive, spasmodic, done on the spur of the moment,
inspired or promoted by the attending circumstances, and
could not be duplicated by themselves. Because the circumstances
of their origin and performance are so peculiar
detection and duplication of Spiritualistic phenomena is
sometimes a most complex task. Not only are mediums
alert to embrace every advantage offered by auto-suggestion
but they also take advantage of every accidental occurrence.
For instance, my greatest feat of mystery was
performed in 1922 at Seacliffe, L. I., on the Fourth of
July, at the home of Mr. B. M. L. Ernest. The children
were waiting to set off their display of fireworks when it
started to rain. The heavens fairly tore loose. Little
Richard in his dismay turned to me and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>“Can’t you make the rain stop?”</p>

<p>“Why certainly,” I replied and raising my hands said
appealingly, “Rain and Storm, I command you to stop.”</p>

<p>This I repeated three times and, as if by miracle, within
the next two minutes the rain stopped and the skies became
clear. Toward the end of the display of fireworks
the little fellow turned to me and with a peculiar gleam in
his eyes said:</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Houdini, it would have stopped raining
anyway.”</p>

<p>I knew I was risking my whole life’s reputation with the
youngster but I said:</p>

<p>“Is that so? I will show you.”</p>

<p>Walking out in front I raised my hands suppliantly
toward the heavens and with all the command and force
I had in me called:</p>

<p>“Listen to my voice, great Commander of the rain, and
once more let the water flow to earth and allow the
flowers and trees to bloom.”</p>

<p>A chill came over me for as if in response to my command
or the prayer of my words another downpour
started, but despite the pleading of the children I refused
to make it stop again. I was not taking any more
chances.</p>

<p>I am also aware of the fact that there are effects produced
by magicians which they declare are accomplished
by natural agencies, which other magicians are entirely
unable to account for or satisfactorily explain. A notable
case was a card performance by Dr. Samuel C. Hooker
which included the levitation of a life-sized head of an
animal, possessed of life-like movement while in a state
of suspension and still there were no visible means of
support. A number of these seances were given to groups
of magicians only. On one occasion a dozen or more of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
the most expert professional magicians were in attendance,
but no one could offer a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>Many magical mysteries as practised for entertainment
are just as incomprehensible as so-called Spiritualistic
Phenomena and it is not to be wondered at that even minds
trained to analytical thinking are deceived and misguided.
Were I at a seance and not able to explain what transpired
it would not necessarily be an acknowledgment that I
believed it to be genuine Spiritualism. The fact that I
have mystified many does not signify that what I have
done, though unexplainable to them, was done by the
help of the Spirits. Mr. Kellar frequently, particularly
during the last two years of his appearance on the stage,
said to the audience:</p>

<p>“Do not be ashamed if I mystify you; I have seen Houdini
and his work and I do not know how he does it.”</p>

<p>The simple fact that a thing looks mysterious to one
does not signify anything beyond the necessity of analytic
investigation for a fuller understanding. But to return
to possibilities; I believe that the great majority of so-called
manifestations can be duplicated but I am not
prepared to include all, because, as before explained, some
are spontaneous, and cannot be reproduced by the mediums
themselves unless the identical opportunity should
present itself, which is as uncertain as lightning striking
twice in the same place—possible but improbable.</p>

<p>It would be extremely difficult, if not out of the question,
to reproduce much of the “phenomena” by description
as given by those who have witnessed it. The lapse
of time and the fact that a story twice told never loses,
renders such reproduction extremely doubtful. Were I
to be challenged to duplicate any particular phase as presented
by a medium, permission would have to be granted
to allow me not less than three demonstrations. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
first, not wishing to accept any one’s word as to what
happened I should want to see the manifestation so that
there would be no surprise attack on my mind afterwards.
At the second sitting I would be prepared to watch what I
had seen at the first sitting and the third time I would
try to completely analyze for duplication. It might be that
some peculiar formation or years of special practice enabled
the medium to do a certain action and naturally it
would require at least three seances to become thoroughly
cognizant of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i>, or the manipulative
process used. If there were no fraud, then there
could be no objection to the demonstrations.</p>

<p>Let us dissect a few of the magician’s statements.
First: Belachini, conjuror to the imperial German Court,
is claimed by Spiritualists as a great magician countenancing
and acknowledging the genuineness of Spiritualism,
but by no possible stretch of imagination could he
be so classed despite the efforts of modern Spiritualists
to prove that he was, for the very nature of his tricks belie
his statement. No present day magician would permit
him to be mentioned as an authority on Spiritualism notwithstanding
the fact that Spiritualists are trying to prove
from his letters that he was, just as they have ever since
the letters were written.</p>

<p>I have received reports from Karl Wilmann, of Hamburg;
A. Herman, of Berlin, and Rosner of Haisenhaid,
to the effect that Belachini was solely an apparatus or
mechanical conjuror with an adroit and daring address.
In fact, his unbounded self-confidence won him the position
for which he is famous. He was performing for
Kaiser Wilhelm I. who sat amazed at his suave dexterity.
The climax of the performance came when Belachini,
bowing, proffered a pen to Wilhelm.</p>

<p>“Take this, your Majesty,” he requested, “and attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
to write with it. I warn you it is a magical pen
and subject only to my control; I can write anything with
it or cause anything to be written; you cannot.”</p>

<p>Wilhelm laughingly took the pen with a confident mien,
hiding his real awe of Belachini. He applied it to the
paper before him but in spite of his most careful efforts,
the pen balked, spluttering and splashing ink, while
Belachini stood by smiling.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Kaiser, “tell me what to write.”</p>

<p>Belachini reflectively caressed his chin, then replied
with a dry smile:</p>

<p>“Write this. I hereby appoint Belachini Court Conjuror.”</p>

<p>The monarch chuckled at the wit and without difficulty
wrote and signed the order.</p>

<p>A second, famous in his day, was “Herr Alexander,” a
magician whose full name was Alexander Heinberger.
He gave seances at the White House for President Polk
who sent him to South America once on a man-of-war.
The President was willing to believe that Heinberger was
guided and aided by the Spirits but Heinberger would
neither affirm nor deny the suspected origin of his feats
but like a good showman left his observers to their own
deductions as was the practice of the Davenport Brothers.
He lived to be ninety years old, and was a most remarkable
old man. I visited him at his home in Munster, Westphalia.</p>

<p>Sometimes a misunderstanding entangles a magician
with Spiritualism. The following instance comes to my
mind. It is a popular belief among Spiritualists that
certain letters and statements bearing the signature of
Robert Houdin are acknowledgments of his belief in Spiritualism.
On the contrary they refer simply to certain
acts of clairvoyance purported to have taken place at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
instance of one Alexis Didier. The first statement has
been translated as an interview of considerable length
which is concluded as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ah, Monsieur (Alexis Didier, as addressed by Houdin),
that may seem so to a man of no experience in these
matters, to the ordinary person,—though even then such
a mistake is hardly admissible,—but to the expert! Just
consider, Monsieur, that all my cards are faked, marked,
often of unequal sizes, or at least artistically arranged.
Again I have my signals and telegraphs. But in this case
a fresh pack was used which I had just taken out of its
wrapper, and which the somnambulist cannot have studied.
There is another point, where deception is impossible,
namely, in the handling of the cards: in the one case, the
entire artlessness of the performance, in the other, that
tell-tale air of effort which nothing can entirely disguise.
Add to this his total blindness, for need I insist on the
impossibility—the absolute impossibility—of his having
seen. <em>Besides, even supposing he could see, how can we
account for the other phenomena?</em> With regard to my
own ‘second-sight’ performances, without being able to
divulge my secret to you now, bear in mind that I am
careful to tell you every evening, that I only promise a
<em>second</em> sight! Consequently in my case a first sight is
indispensable.</p>

<p>“The following day Robert Houdin gave me (Alexis
Didier) the following signed statement:</p>

<p>“‘While I am by no means inclined to accept the compliments
which M—— is kind enough to pay me, and
while I am particularly anxious that my signature should
not be held to prejudice in any way my opinion, either for
or against magnetism, still I cannot refrain from affirming
that the incidents recorded above are ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT, <em>and that the more I think about them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
more impossible I find it to class them with those which
form the subject of my profession and of my performances</em>.</p>

<p class="sigright p0 b0">“‘Robert Houdin.</p>

<p class="p0">“‘May 4th, 1847.’”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that the signature in this
case refers to a mystification by card handling, clairvoyance,
forecasting, etc. His second letter was written a
fortnight later and is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Monsieur, (Alexis Didier) as I informed you, I was
anxious to have a second sitting. This sitting which was
held at Marcillet’s house yesterday proved even more
extraordinary than the first, and has left me without a
shadow of a doubt as to the clairvoyance of Alexis. I went
to this seance, fully determined to keep a careful watch on
the game of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">écarté</i>, which had astounded me so much
before. This time I took much greater precautions than
at the first seance, for distrusting myself I took a friend,
whose natural imperturbability enabled him to form a cool
judgment and helped me to steady mine. I append an
account of what took place, and you will see that trickery
could never have produced such results as those which I
am about to recount.</p>

<p>“I undo a pack of cards, which I had brought with me
in a marked wrapper to guard against another pack being
substituted for it. I shuffle and it is my deal. I deal with
every precaution known to a man well up in all the dodges
of his profession. It is all of no use, Alexis stops me,
and pointing to one of the cards that I had just placed
in front of him on the table, says:</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got the King.’</p>

<p>“‘But you can’t possibly know yet; the trump card has
not been turned up.’</p>

<p>“‘You will see,’ he replies. ‘Go on.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>“As a matter of fact I turn up the eight of Diamonds,
and his was the King of Diamonds. The game was continued
in an odd enough manner, for he told me the cards
I had to play, though my cards were hidden under the
table and held close together in my hands. To each lead
of mine he played one of his own cards without turning it
up, and it was always the right card to have played against
mine. I left this seance then in the greatest possible state
of amazement, and convinced of the utter impossibility of
chance or conjuring having been responsible for such marvellous
results.—Yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="sigright">
(Signed)   “Robert Houdin,<br />
“16th May, 1847.”
</p>
</div>

<p>I here embrace the opportunity to make a correction of
a statement in “The Unmasking of Robert Houdin” (page
287). The record and source of information at that time
was published in Berlin, Germany. It gave the impression
that the “letters” cited above referred to Spiritualistic
phenomena, but now, having come into possession of a
true translation of these documents complete, as published
by the Society for Psychical Research,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> I am of the
opinion that Houdin did treat the subject of Spiritualism
with conservative prudence and impartiality, as recorded
by Professor Hoffmann.</p>

<p>But I wish to say that in my estimation of Robert Houdin,
despite his wonderful reputation and record as mentioned
in Larousse’s Encyclopedia, I cannot agree with his
statements, because he misrepresented so much in his
“Memoirs of a Magician.” In “The Unmasking of Robert
Houdin” I devoted a whole chapter to his ignorance of
magic and by investigating I have found that he was not
competent as an investigator of the claims of Spiritualists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>It came quite as a shocking surprise to me to find that
the letters which were supposed to refer to Spiritualistic
seances, and which have been quoted so often as being
such, refer only to his experience with Alexis the clairvoyant.
It must be apparent, even to the casual observer,
that they have no bearings whatsoever on Spiritualism, but
refer only to sittings with a clairvoyant in a game of sharp
card practice. Knowing, as I do now, what it all meant,
the fact that he wrote the letters does not surprise me in
the least. I believe a lot of things transpired in that room
which he could not see, or know whether there was confederacy,
for clairvoyants as well as mediums often get
information from the most unexpected sources. Clairvoyance,
like Spiritualism, was not in the direct line of professional
observation to Robert Houdin. What would he
or any of his confreres, who were supposed to be adepts
at that time, say if they could visit a seance of some of
our present day clairvoyants who are appearing before the
public and making use of radio, wireless, induction coils,
etc.? What a wonderful bunch of letters they might write
because of the simple fact that they could not tell how the
effects were produced. It is ridiculous for any magician
to say that the work he witnesses is not accomplished by
conjuring or legerdemain simply because he cannot solve
the problem.</p>

<p>As to his qualifications for adjudging the work of a
clairvoyant, we have but to revert to his own narration of
the origin and development of second-sight as used by
himself. This account can be found in the English edition
of his Memoirs:</p>

<p>“My two children were playing one day in the drawing-room
at a game they had invented for their own amusement;
the younger had bandaged his elder brother’s eyes
and made him guess the objects that he touched, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
later he guessed right they changed places. This simple
game suggested to me the most complicated idea that
ever crossed my mind. Pursued by the notion, I ran and
shut myself in my workshop, and was fortunately in that
happy state when the mind follows easily the combinations
traced by fancy. I rested my head in my hands,
and in my excitement laid down the first principles of
second sight.”</p>

<p>It is hard to reconcile this statement with truth in view
of the fact that memory training, as he describes it, was
in vogue and practised long before<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> his time and is not
the way second sight is learned. It could not have been
discovered or invented by him except coincidentally by
his utter lack of knowledge bearing on the methods of
seership and clairvoyance as practised either in his time or
antiquity. Let me explain clearly, and I hope once for
all, the valuelessness of his letters as far as they relate to
Spiritualism and clairvoyance.</p>

<p>In the first place the blindfold test<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> as produced by
Alexis Didier to mystify Houdin. Putting cotton on the
eyes and covering it with a handkerchief is now used by
amateurs in the cheapest kind of what we term “muscle
reading.” There is not the slightest difficulty in seeing
beneath such a bandage, sometimes over it, and the range
of vision can easily be determined by a test. In Paris I
saw a mysterious performer, named Benoval, who had his
eyes glued together with adhesive paper, on top of it
cotton was placed, and over the cotton a handkerchief,
but he danced around bottles and burning candles without
any difficulty.</p>

<p>Regarding the information given clairvoyantly to Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Robert Houdin during another seance with Alexis;
Houdin at that time was one of the best known characters
of Paris, a public person, and it was the easiest thing in
the world for Alexis to gather information concerning him
and his family. Houdin may not have been acquainted
with the subtlety of what we now term “fishing,” “stalling,”
or “killing time,” in order to get information or put
something over. He might have been mystified but his
knowledge of Spiritualism and clairvoyance was nil
according to his own statement.</p>

<p>One of the demonstrations presented by Alexis to
mystify Houdin was the reading from a book, by the seer,
several pages in advance of a page designated by the person
holding the book at the time. There does not seem
to be any really authentic details reported regarding the
exact performance of this man, Alexis, consequently much
must of necessity be left to conjecture and a knowledge of
the orthodox methods for doing such things. Such information
as there is available seems to have passed through
several hands and in all probability was first presented to
the public through a Spiritualistic publication. However,
the particular effect referred to is neither new nor
strange but has always been a feature in second sight acts
and with clairvoyants. The reading of a book from
memory is quite possible to persons of abnormal mind or
special training in co-relative memorizing; a very clever
system with surprising possibilities. There are many
cases on record of persons who, having read a book once,
could repeat every word and even tell where the punctuation
was. The ability to recite entire chapters or parts
of them is much more common, and is not difficult for
trained minds such as are possessed by members of theatrical
stock companies, who are oftentimes obliged to
commit to memory simultaneously three or four plays, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
this too while on the road. In order to be prepared to
play one part in the afternoon and an entirely different
one the same night, stock actors frequently have to do
some marvellous memorization work on short notice. It
is not an exception but the rule. They get long parts with
from fifty to a hundred and fifty “sides,” each side containing
from one to ten speeches. The foster-mother’s
speech in “Common Clay” is over three pages, and the
Duchess’ in the first act of Oscar Wilde’s “Lady Wildmere’s
Fan” is about four pages. The well-known actress,
Miss Beatrice Moreland, told me that she memorized them
both in an hour and was almost letter perfect. The actor’s
rule for memorizing parts is to take ten pages first and
when they have been committed to memory take ten more.
If such feats can be done as the result of training how
easy it must be for an abnormal mind to memorize a
book.</p>

<p>There comes to my mind a phenomenal memory feat
by a blind slave boy called “Blind Tom.” He would listen
while a composer played an original composition. As
soon as the composer finished Tom seated himself at the
piano and reproduced the entire piece with all the composer’s
delicacy of shading and technique.</p>

<p>There is a case on record of a memory performance, I
think in Rousseau’s time, where a poet read a piece of
poetry, a long monody, to the King. At its conclusion the
King said:</p>

<p>“Why, that is quite an old story, I have heard it before.
As a matter of fact the man who related it to me is in
my palace now; I will send for him and have him recite
it for you.”</p>

<p>He spoke to a servant who left the room and returned
in a few minutes with the memory man who stood in the
center of the room and recited the entire poem. It appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
that the King, wishing to mystify the poet, had the
memory man hidden in a closet where he could hear the
poem read.</p>

<p>Inaudi, a Frenchman, has given performances both in
America and Europe in which he looks at a blackboard
covered with figures written by a committee, then turns
around and immediately tells correctly every figure on the
board and its position; adds, subtracts, and multiplies
them, with lightning-like rapidity, and all without looking
at the board a second time. He makes no claim to psychic
or clairvoyant powers but simply explains his wonderful
performance as being the result of a photographic memory.</p>

<p>I might repeat such instances indefinitely but I think
I have given enough to substantiate my claim of precedence
for God’s natural laws and their marvellous, even
incomprehensible working, over any so-called supernatural
endowment of a class of people so thoroughly disqualified
by all known laws of moral sociology, as many professional
mediums are admitted to be by their most ardent supporters.</p>

<p>Even such an eminent mystifier as Robert Houdin can
misjudge when it comes to fathoming the so-called manifestations
of the professional medium. As I have explained
in “The Unmasking of Robert Houdin,” page 291,
he makes two flagrant errors in attempting to explain the
Davenport Brothers’ trick. First he claims that “by dint
of special practice on the part of the mediums, the thumb
is made to lie flat in the hand, when the whole assumes a
cylindrical form of scarcely greater diameter than the
<em>wrist</em>.” Secondly, he declares that the Davenport Brothers
possessed the power of seeing in the dark as the result
of practice or training.</p>

<p>Releasing myself from fastenings of all sorts, from
ropes to straightjackets, has been my profession for over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
thirty-five years, therefore I am in a position to positively
contradict Houdin’s first statement. I have met thousands
of persons who claimed that the rope trick as well as the
handcuff trick was accomplished by folding the hand together
or by making the wrist larger than the hand, but I
have never met the man or woman who could make the
hand smaller than the wrist. I have even gone so far as
to have iron bands made to press my hands together, hoping
to make them smaller than my wrists eventually, but
it was no use. Even if the thumbs were cut away I believe
it would be impossible to slip a rope that is properly
bound around the wrist. Furthermore I know that Houdin
was wrong in regard to the Davenports because of what
Ira Erastus Davenport himself told me.</p>

<p>Equally preposterous is the gift of seeing in the dark
with which Houdin endowed the Davenports. Professor
Hoffmann defends Houdin by citing instances of prisoners
who had been confined in a dungeon for an indefinite
period and had learned to see in the dark. Ira Erastus
Davenport laughed at the idea and Morelle, who was confined
in a dungeon for a number of years, told me that
all the years he had spent in darkness did not accustom
his eyesight at all and that to have seen an article plainly
he would have been forced to hold it close to his eyes
and even then would have had to stretch his imagination.</p>

<p>Baggally, an investigator, a member of the Society for
Psychical Research, London, England, emphatically records
that he believes the Zancigs are <em>genuine telepathists</em>,
and my friend, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, though he says
that Zancig has given proof numerous times that he works
with a code, nevertheless has stated in writing that he
believed the Zancigs to be genuine. I want to go on record
that the Zancigs never impressed me as being anything
but clever, silent and signal codists. Zancig has admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
freely to members of the Society of American Magicians,
of which he is a member, that they were not telepathists
but, as we term it, “second sight artists.” They
simply have a wonderful code which the public cannot
detect. It is interesting to know that after Mrs. Zancig’s
death, Zancig took a street-car conductor from Philadelphia
and broke him in to do the act. This young man
soon quit his teacher, married, and began presenting the
act with his wife. Then Zancig took young David Bamberg,
an intelligent son of Theodore Bamberg, one of
our well-known magicians. The boy proved exceptionally
clever but on account of unexpected circumstances he left
and went abroad. Zancig came to me for an assistant and
I introduced him to an actress. He said he would guarantee
to teach her the code inside of a month, but they
never came to an agreement on financial matters. Zancig
has now married again, this time a school teacher, and they
are doing a very clever performance. In passing I would
note that in 1906 or 1907 I engaged Zancig to go with
my show. I had ample opportunity to watch his system
and codes. They are swift, sure, and silent, and I must
give him credit for being expertly adept in his chosen
line of mystery, but I have his personal word, given before
a witness, that telepathy does not enter into it.</p>

<p>Charles Morritt has a code for second sight which is
very simple and can be taught to anyone in thirty minutes.
He has given me the secret. He gave this code to a banker
who performed it with his sister, and Morritt, although
he had taught the signals, could not follow or detect them
once they began to work smoothly. Of course he knew
what they were doing but simply could not follow them.</p>

<p>Regarding the possibility of using codes and cues before
others without being detected I can say positively that it
is not only possible but simple and practical. I had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
fox terrier by the name of “Bobby” that I trained to pick
up cards by a cue. On May 31, 1918, I performed with
this dog before the Society of American Magicians and I
do not believe that there was one in the audience who
detected my silent cue. I spoke about this to a number of
expert professionals who thought, to all intents and purposes,
that Bobby was listening to my speech, whereas
I was silently cueing him all the time. I do not wish to
expose the silent cue as I know that the great dog trainers
of the world use it and it would not be fair to them to
make it public. I was able to give Bobby his silent cue
in any room or even a newspaper office and the spectators
could watch me closely all the time because I never made
a move they could see or a sound they could hear.</p>

<p>It is common to train other animals in a similar way.
During one of my tours in Germany I saw a horse called
“Kluge Hans” that was able to spell, add, subtract, pick
out cards, and with his feet make one tap for yes and two
taps for no. Kluge Hans fooled the professors for a long
time but finally it came out that he got his cues from the
trainer’s assistant. It is not generally known that, owing
to the position of his eyes, a horse can look backwards to
a certain degree and the investigators did not notice the
assistant who stood just back of the horse’s head.</p>

<p>At one time William Eglinton, an English medium,
was undoubtedly considered by Spiritualists the most powerful
professional psychic not only in England but
throughout a greater part of Europe. In 1876 he held
the palm as a successor to Slade in slate writing tricks.
He was a strong card for the cause and was extolled and
lauded to the skies by the Spiritualistic press. He produced
varied phenomena in addition to his slate writing
effects, such as the movement of articles, production of
Spirit lights, and materialization. The Spiritualists have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
told that “he was so skillful that several practised conjurors
as well as many investigators” were at a loss to
detect or account for his methods. That may have been
so. Half a century ago conjurors were not up on Spiritualism
as they are to-day, and besides, it must be conceded
that even conjurors are not immune to being deceived.
Nevertheless there were conjurors and lay investigators
fully qualified to discover and expose his frauds.</p>

<p>In 1876, while in his prime as a medium, he was exposed
in the materialization of an Arab. This Arab’s
flowing beard and draperies were very familiar to English
Spiritualists and as proof of the actual materialization
sitters were permitted to cut fragments from the beard
and robes. Archdeacon Colley, an interested member of
a circle of sitters, suspecting fraud, secured some clippings
and a few days later when opportunity offered “he <em>found</em>
in Eglinton’s portmanteau a false beard and a quantity of
muslin to which the detached relics perfectly corresponded.”
He was also exposed several other times but
this did not prevent the Spiritualist paper, <i>Light</i>, from
publishing in October, 1886, a mass of testimony given
by more than a hundred observers, including persons of
high culture and social standing, to show that the phenomena
at his seances were not due to any deliberate action
on the part of the medium but to “conclusively establish
the existence of some objective, intelligent force,
capable of acting externally to the medium and in contravention
of the recognized laws of matter.”</p>

<p>The publication of such statements inspired Professor
H. Carvill Lewis<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> to visit Eglinton for the purpose of
investigation and arrangements were made for him to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
a first sitting in November just a month after the extravagant
statement in <i>Light</i>. Aware of the frailty of memory
Professor Lewis made notes during the seance and wrote
out his deductions and conclusions immediately after.
He discovered at an early stage that close scrutiny did not
produce an atmosphere sufficiently wholesome for desired
results. While his attention was concentrated on the
medium the “<em>objective intelligent force</em>” seemed totally
inoperative, but whenever he turned his attention from
the medium and apparently became absorbed in making
notes the “<em>intelligent force</em>” became active instanter. Under
the observation of Professor Lewis, Eglinton failed
utterly at times and at others simply <em>declined</em> to work
when conditions were against him. Professor Lewis
quotes him as claiming that he had converted Kellar to
Spiritualism but refutes such a claim in the following
words:</p>

<p>“So far is this from being the case that Mr. Kellar,
whom I know personally, is nightly offering in America
twenty pounds to anyone who will produce Spiritualistic
phenomena that he cannot imitate by conjuring.”</p>

<p>The facts are that Kellar had a sitting with Eglinton in
Calcutta to see if he could reproduce his effects by natural
means. His mind was unbiased, and failing to detect
Eglinton’s method he remarked, “If my senses are to be
relied on the writing is in no way the result of trickery
or sleight-of-hand.” But note the qualification in his
remark: “If my senses are to be relied upon.” Evidently
he had his misgivings then and he must have worked
out the problem soon after for two years later, as Professor
Lewis told, he was producing the effect in America,
and not long after performed both the Slade and Eglinton
slate tricks before the Seybert Commission in Philadelphia
to its complete amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>It was not strange that Kellar did not detect Eglinton’s
method instantly nor is it strange that he acknowledged
that he was baffled. No magician is immune from being
deceived and it is no way beneath a magician’s dignity
or demeaning to professional reputation to openly admit
that he cannot always account for what he thinks he sees.</p>

<p>Ernst Basch, of the famous Basch family, who made
the major apparatus for the magicians of the world, told
me that he made hundreds of wireless tables before wireless
was so well known under the name of “The Bewitched
Table.” He was a great illusion inventor and
builder with a wonderful knowledge but in all his experience
and contact with mediums he had never seen anything
which would make him believe in Spiritualism.
Neither has Francis J. Martinka, who traveled around the
world with Haselmeyer, the magician, and who has sold
magical apparatus in New York City for over forty years.
I have the following letter from him in regard to Spirit-communication.</p>

tricks or apparatus to the great majority of magicians,
and indirectly to well-known mediums (one instance you

<p class="in0">My dear <span class="locked">Houdini:—</span></p>

<p>For almost sixty-one years I have been witnessing and
investigating Spiritualism and Spiritism as propagated by
mediums through their so-called communications with the
dead. Up to this time I have not met a medium, celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
or obscure, that was not a gross fraud, nor seen a manifestation
that was not trickery and that could not be duplicated
by any expert magician and that without the conditions and
restrictions demanded by the mediums or explained by
perfectly natural mental or physical methods.</p>

<p>Sure there are certain mental and psychic phenomena
peculiar to a few persons who use their special gift to delude
believers (as well as other credulous persons) with the
belief that their work is supernatural, but even these phenomena
can be analyzed and explained by any competent
psychologist.</p>

<p>The thing that first aroused my suspicion and disbelief
and started me to thinking and investigating, was, why
could not the dear departed communicate direct with their
relatives and friends? why talk, or rap, or write or materialize
through a medium, the majority of whom are ignorant
men and women, though shrewd and cunning; and if
through a medium why should the medium need a control,
especially of an old Indian chief or prattling Indian maiden?
Why a control at all?</p>

<p>True there are a few well educated, intelligent and refined
mediums in the business and which advantage makes
them the more dangerous but none the less fraudulent
than their more ignorant confreres.</p>

<p>I repeat, that from my first seance in Aurora, Ind., February,
1863, until this date of 1923 I have never met a
medium that was not a fraud or seen a manifestation of any
kind or character that was not fraudulent. In other words
was a more or less crude or skillful magical performance
by a clever trickster or tricksteress.</p>

<span class="subhead">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> has been my desire in this book to convey to the
reader my views regarding Spiritualism which are the result
of study and investigation, the startling feature of
which has been the utter inability of the average human
being to describe accurately anything he or she has witnessed.
Many sitters, devoid of the sense of acute observation,
prefer to garnish and embellish their stories with
the fruits of their fertile imaginations, adding a choice bit
every time the incident is reported, and eventually, by a
trick of the brain, really believing what they say. It is
evident, therefore, that by clever misguidance and apt
misdirection of attention, a medium can accomplish seeming
wonders. The sitter becomes positively self-deluded
and actually thinks he has seen weird phantoms or has
heard the voice of a beloved one.</p>

<p>To my knowledge I have never been baffled in the least
by what I have seen at seances. Everything I have seen
has been merely a form of mystification. The secret of
all such performances is to catch the mind off guard and
the moment after it has been surprised to follow up with
something else that carries the intelligence along with the
performer, even against the spectator’s will. When it
is possible to do this with a highly developed mind like
Mr. Kellar’s, one trained in magic mystery, and when
scientific men of the intelligence of Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, the late William Crookes and William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
T. Stead, can be made to believe by such means how
much easier it must be in the case of ordinary human
beings.</p>

<p>I cannot accept nor even comprehend the intelligence
which justifies the conclusion, so often put in print as
the opinion of brainy men supporting Spiritualism, that
admits the possibility of a result being accomplished by
natural means but nevertheless assert their sincere belief
that the identical performance by a professional medium
is solely of supernatural origin and guidance, nor can I
understand the reasoning that, acknowledging the disreputable
character of certain practitioners or mediums,
deliberately defends the culprits in the performance of
what has been proven a crime. Is it true logic, logic that
would stand either in court or club room, to say that a
medium caught cheating ninety-nine times out of a
hundred was honest the hundredth time because not
caught? Would the reader trust a servant who stole
ninety-nine articles and then professed innocence when
the hundredth article was missing?</p>

<p>Sir Conan Doyle asks in all innocence, “Is it really scientific
to deny and at the same time refuse to investigate?”
My answer is most emphatically “no.” Nevertheless, they
absolutely oppose all honest efforts at investigation, and
justify the mediums in refusing to work when the conditions
are not just as they want them. When one is invited
to a dark seance for the purpose of investigation
and finds the conditions so fixed as to bar him from enquiring
too closely and compel him to be content with
merely looking on he stands a poor chance of getting at
the facts, and should he dare to disregard the “rules of
the circle” and the seance results in a blank, the investigator
is charged with having brought an atmosphere of
incredulity to bear which prevents manifestation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>I do not affirm that the claims of Spiritualism are disproved
by such failures but I do say that if under such
circumstances one dared to investigate properly and sanely,
and to cross-examine, as he most certainly would do in
any other form of investigation, scientific, or in the other
walks of life, Spiritualism would not be so generously
accepted. In justification the psychic says that darkness
or excessively dim light is perfectly legitimate and that
tangible investigation might result in <em>injury</em> or even <em>death</em>
to the medium. The folly of any such fear has been
proven time and again by the unexpected play of a flash
light. Even the ardent supporters who lay emphasis on
such an absurdity have, according to their own confession,
made, or had made, flashlight photographs and there has
never been a single case of harm or disaster reported.
This necessity for darkness seems but the grossest invention
of the medium to divert, even to the point of intimidation,
the attention of the sitters. Such a necessity cannot
be accorded a logical reason for existing under test
conditions to demonstrate a scientific subject. It can be
supported only as a visionary, speculative superstition; an
instrument to foster hallucinatory illusion and as an admirable
subterfuge to cover fraud.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur says:</p>

<p>“If you want to send a telegram you must go to a telegraph
office. If you want to telephone you must first pick
up the receiver and give your message to either an operator
or a waiting automaton.”</p>

<p>Very well, I have gone to the operator between the
Beyond and this earthly sphere, I have gone to the telegraph
office that receives the message in code, to the so-called
<em>medium</em>. What would be more wonderful to me
than to be able to converse with my beloved mother?
Surely there is no love in this world like a mother’s love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
no closeness of spirit, no other heart throbs that beat alike;
but I have not heard from my blessed Mother, except
through the dictates of the inmost recesses of my heart,
the thoughts which fill my brain and the memory of her
teachings.</p>

<p>Would not my private secretary, John William Sargent,
come back to me and tell me the secrets of the beyond if
it were possible? Did he not, just before he died, tell me
that he would come to me if there was any way of doing
it? More than being a private secretary, he was my
friend,—true, loyal, sacrificing,—knew me for thirty
years. He has not come back to me and he would if it were
possible.</p>

<p>I had compacts with a round dozen. Each one promised
me faithfully to come back if it were possible. I
have even gone so far as to create secret codes and hand-grips.
Sargent had a certain word he was to repeat to
me; William Berol, the eminent mental expert, gave me
the secret handshake a few hours before he died and did
not regain consciousness after silently telling me that he
remembered our compact; Atlanta Hall, niece of President
Pierce, a woman ninety years of age, who had had seances
with the greatest mediums that visited Boston, called for
me just before her death, clasped my hand and gave me
our agreed-upon grip which she was to give me through
a medium. They have never come back to me! Does
that prove anything? I have attended a number of
seances since their death, the mediums have called for
them, and when their spirit forms were supposed to appear
not one of them could give me the proper signal. Would
I have received it? I’ll wager I would have. There was
love of some kind between each of these friends who are
gone and myself. It is needless to point out the love of
a mother and son; the love of a real friend; the love of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
a woman of ninety toward a man who held her dear; the
love of a philosopher toward a man who respected his
life study,—they were all loves, each strong, each binding.
If these persons, with all the love they bore in their heart
for me and all the love I have in my heart for them,
did not return, what about those who did not hold me
close, who had no interest in me? Why should they come
back and mine not?</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has repeatedly told the Spiritualists
that I will eventually see the light and embrace
Spiritualism. If the memory of a loved one, gone to the
protection of the hands of the Great Mystifier means
Spiritualism, then truly I do believe in it. But if Spiritualism
is to be founded on the tricks of exposed mediums,
feats of magic, resort to trickery, then I say unflinchingly
I do not believe, and more, I will not believe. I have
said many times that I am willing to believe, want to
believe, will believe, if the Spiritualists can show any substantiated
proof, but until they do I shall have to live on,
believing from all the evidence shown me and from what I
have experienced that Spiritualism has not been proven
satisfactorily to the world at large and that none of the
evidence offered has been able to stand up under the
fierce rays of investigation.</p>

<p>It is not for us to prove that the mediums are dishonest,
it is for them to prove that they <em>are</em> honest. They have
made a statement, the most serious statement in recent
times, for it affects the welfare, the mental attitude and
means a complete revolution of age-old beliefs and customs
of the world. If there is anything to Spiritualism
then the world should know it. If there is nothing to it,
if it is, as it appears, built on a flimsy framework of misdirection,
then too the universe must be told. There is
too much at stake for a flighty passing, for unsubstantiated
truths.</p>

<span class="subheada"><i>Statement of Margaret Fox</i></span></h3>

<p>“Do you know that there is something behind the shadowy
mask of Spiritualism that the public can hardly guess at? I
am stating now what I know, not because I actually participated
in it, for I would never be a party to such promiscuous nastiness,
but because I had plenty of opportunity, as you may imagine, of
verifying it. Under the name of this dreadful, this horrible,
hypocrisy—Spiritualism—everything that is improper, bad and
immoral is practiced. They go even so far as to have what they
call ‘Spiritual children.’ They pretend to something like the
immaculate conception! Could anything be more blasphemous,
more disgusting, more thinly deceptive than that? In London I
went in disguise to a quiet seance at the house of a wealthy man,
and I saw a so-called materialization. The effect was produced
with the aid of luminous paper, the luster of which was reflected
upon the operator. The figure thus displayed was that of a
woman, virtually nude, being enveloped in transparent gauze, the
face alone being concealed. This was one of those seances to
which the privileged non-believing friends of believing Spiritualists
could have access. But there are other seances where
none but the most tried and trusted are admitted, and where there
are shameless goings on that vie with the secret Saturnalia of the
Romans. I could not describe these things to you, because I
would not.”</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen:—In introducing to your notice the
remarkable phenomena which have attended the gentlemen, who
are not brothers, who are about to appear before you, I do not
deem it necessary to offer my observations upon their extraordinary
manifestations. I shall therefore at once commence a long
rigmarole for the purpose of distracting your attention, and filling
your intelligent heads with perplexity. I need not tell this
enlightened audience that the manifestations they are about to
witness are produced by occult power, the meaning of which I
don’t clearly understand; but, we simply bring before your
notice facts, and from these you must form your own conclusions.
Concerning the early life of these gentlemen, columns of the most
uninteresting description could be written; I will mention one
or two interesting facts connected with these remarkable men, and
for the truth of which I personally vouch. In early life, one of
them to the perfect unconcern of everybody else, was constantly
and most unconsciously floating about his peaceful dwelling in
the arms of his amiable nurse, while, on other occasions, he was
frequently tied with invisible hands to his mother’s apron strings.
Peculiarities of a like nature were exhibited by his companion,
whose acquaintance with various Spirits commenced many years
ago, and has increased to the present moment with pleasure to
himself and profit to others. These gentlemen have not been celebrated
throughout the vast continent of America, they have not
astonished the civilized world, but they have travelled in various
parts of this glorious land—the land of Bacon—and are about
to appear in a phase in your glorious city of Manchester. Many
really sensible and intelligent individuals seem to think that the
requirement of darkness seems to infer trickery. So it does. But
I will strive to convince you that it does not. Is not a dark
chamber essential to the process of photography? And what
would we reply to him who would say ‘I believe photography is
a humbug, do it all in the light and we will believe otherwise’?
It is true that we know why darkness is essential to the production
of a sun picture; and if scientific men will subject these phenomena
to analysis, they will find why darkness is essential to
our manifestations. But we don’t want them to find out, we want
them to avoid a common-sense view of the mystery. We want
them to be blinded by our puzzle, and to believe with implicit
faith in the greatest humbug in the nineteenth century.”</p>

<span class="subheada"><i>Lord Adare’s Story.</i></span></h3>

<p>That is the way Spiritualistic chroniclers tell this story, but
Lord Dunraven, in a letter to the Editor of <cite>The Weekly Dispatch</cite>,
London, Eng., March 21, 1920, gives quite a different version
of the occurrence, and because of its intrinsic worth as refutation
of the loud claim made by Spiritualists I am reproducing the
entire article including head lines:</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">“MEDIUM’S ENTRY BY WINDOW</p>

<hr class="narrow10" />

<p class="center larger">“WHAT I SAW AT ASHLEY HOUSE</p>

<p class="center smaller b1">“<i>By Lord Dunraven.</i></p>

<p>“My attention has been drawn to accounts of a debate on
‘Spiritualism’ on March 11 between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
and Mr. Joseph McCabe, in which the latter is reported to have
described the alleged wafting of Mr. D. D. Home from window
to window as one of the greatest pieces of trickery to be found in
the whole Spiritualistic movement.</p>

<p>“Assuming the substantial accuracy of the report, I, as the
sole survivor of those present on the occasion, think it my duty,
in justice to the dead, to mention the facts as recorded by me
at the time.</p>

<p>“They are extracted from a long letter descriptive of the
evening to my father, who was much interested in the subject.
Whether my letter was submitted to the others present I cannot
now say for certain. I have no doubt that it was, for my custom
was always to ask others present to test the accuracy of any
record that I kept.</p>

<p>“The date was December 16, 1868. Those present were myself
(then Lord Adare), the late Lord Crawford, (then Master of
Lindsay), a cousin of mine, Mr. Wynne (Charlie) and Mr. D.
D. Home.</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center larger">“ON THE THIRD FLOOR</p>

<p>“The scene was Ashley House (in Ashley-place). Speaking
from memory, it consisted of two rooms facing the front—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
is, looking on Ashley-place—a passage at the back running the
length of the two rooms, a door in each room connecting it with
the passage. The locality is thus described in the letter to my
father:</p>

<p>“‘Outside each window is a small balcony or ledge, 19 in.
deep, bounded by stone balustrade, 18 in. high. The balustrades
of the two windows are 7 ft. 4 in. apart, measuring from the nearest
points. A string-course, 4 in. wide, runs between the windows
at the level of the bottom of the balustrade, and another, 3 in.
wide, at the level of the top. Between the window at which
Home went out and that at which he came in the wall recedes 6
in. The rooms are on the third floor.’</p>

<p>“The following account of the incident is extracted from the
letter to my father:</p>

<p>“He (Home) then said to us, ‘Do not be afraid, and on no
account leave your places;’ and he went out into the passage.</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center larger">“FROM ROOM TO ROOM</p>

<p>“Lindsay suddenly said, ‘Oh, good heavens! I know what he
is going to do; it is too fearful.’ Adare: ‘What is it?’ Lindsay:
‘I cannot tell you; it is too horrible! Adah says that I
must tell you; he is going out of the window in the other room,
and coming in at this window.’</p>

<p>“We heard Home go into the next room, heard the window
thrown up, and presently Home appeared standing upright outside
our window. He opened the window and walked in quite
cooly. ‘Ah,’ he said, ‘you were good this time,’ referring to our
having sat still and not wished to prevent him. He sat down and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Charlie: ‘What are you laughing at?’ Home: ‘We are
thinking that if a policeman had been passing and had looked up
and seen a man turning round and round along the wall in the
air he would have been much astonished. Adare, shut the
window in the next room.’</p>

<p>“I got up, shut the window, and in coming back remarked that
the window was not raised a foot, and that I could not think how
he had managed to squeeze through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p class="p1 b1 center larger">“OUT, HEAD FIRST</p>

<p>“He arose and said ‘Come and see.’ I went with him; he told
me to open the window as it was before, I did so; he told me to
stand a little distance off; he then went through the open space,
head first, quite rapidly, his body being nearly horizontal and
apparently rigid. He came in again, feet foremost, and we
returned to the other room.</p>

<p>“It was so dark I could not see clearly how he was supported
outside. He did not appear to grasp, or rest upon, the
balustrade, but rather to be swung out and in.”</p>

<p>“Such are the facts as narrated at the time. I make no comment
except this. Rigorously speaking, it is incorrect to say, as
I think has been said, that we <em>saw</em> Mr. Home wafted from one
window to the other.</p>

<p>“As to whether he was or was not, I am concerned only to
state the facts as observed at the time, not to make deductions
from them.”</p>

<p>In view of this publication, it is quite natural to infer that
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was cognizant of it at the time of its
appearance, because of his controversy with Mr. Joseph McCabe,
on that subject; therefore, it is difficult to reconcile that thought
with the fact of Sir Arthur’s unmitigated praise and endorsement
of a man such as all adduced evidence has branded a charlatan.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_D">D<br />

<span class="subheada"><i>Luther R. Marsh and the Huylers</i></span></h3>

<p>In 1903, Luther R. Marsh again fell into the hands of charlatans
as Mr. Isaac K. Funk tells in his book “The Widow’s
Mite and Other Psychic Phenomena.” A court set aside the
assignment of several insurance policies which Marsh had made
to a medium known as Mrs. Huyler. Mr. Funk tells the story
as follows:</p>

<p>“On the day Mr. Marsh transferred the policies he (Huyler)
and his wife had gone to Mr. Marsh’s room, where Mrs.
Huyler claimed to hold communication with the Spirits and
told Mr. Marsh there was a terrible uproar in Spiritland because
he declined to transfer the policies. She told him that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Spiritualistic wife, Adelaide Neilson, was tearing her hair and
weeping, and heaping reproaches upon him. His wife, Mrs.
Marsh, was acting in the same fashion, and his father-in-law,
‘Sunset,’ Alvin Stewart, was exceedingly wroth.</p>

<p>“Mr. Marsh was alarmed at this manifestation of Spiritualistic
displeasure, and agreed to transfer the policies. At the last
moment he hesitated and claimed that because his will was made
out he thought it better to postpone the matter a little while; but
Mrs. Huyler insisted that he go across the way to a lawyer’s
office, and he did so.</p>

<p>“While he was gone Mrs. Huyler admitted that the trance
was a ‘fake’ and said that she wanted to get all she could from
the ‘old fool’ before he died.</p>

<p>“Mr. Marsh returned to the room presently and assured her
that the transfer had been made as she desired. As soon as
this evidence had been given by Huyler, Justice Marean ended
the proceedings.</p>

<p>“‘This man is a thief and a fraud,’ he said turning to Huyler,
‘and he acted the part of a thief when he and his wife conspired
to secure those policies by the means he has just related.’”</p>

<span class="subheada"><i>Judge Edmonds</i></span></h3>

<p>Judge Edmonds was born in Hudson, N. Y., in 1799, received
a college education and studied law. In 1819 he entered
the law office of President Van Buren. In 1828 he was appointed
Recorder of Hudson and in 1831 was elected to the
State Senate by an unprecedented majority. In 1843 he was
appointed Inspector of the State Prison at Sing Sing holding
the position until 1845 when he resigned to become a Circuit
Judge of the First Judicial District. Later he was elected Judge
of the State Supreme Court and finally in 1851 became a
member of the Court of Appeals. These various offices gave
him experience in the widest range of judicial duties; he had a
greatly developed mentality and was known as the shrewdest
judge of his time.</p>

<p>In 1850 he lost his wife with whom he had lived for over
thirty years. He was very much affected by her death and his
mind became occupied with inquiries concerning the nature and
conditions of death, frequently spending the greater part of
the night reading and reflecting on the subject. One midnight
he seemed to hear the voice of his wife speaking a sentence to
him. It was his doom. He started as though shot and from
that time on devoted all his time, money and energy to Spiritualism.
His faith did not waver to the end. On his death bed
he claimed to be surrounded by Spirit forms and declared that
by reason of entering their sphere in an advanced state of
spiritual development he would be able to send back messages
and proofs of Spiritualism at once. He died April 5th, 1874
(the very date of my birth). I doubt if the history of Spiritualism
can point out a man of greater brilliancy who ruined
his life following up this “will-o-the-wisp” to relieve his grief.</p>

<span class="subheada"><i>Doyle and the “Denver Express.”</i></span></h3>

<p>This reminds me of a conversation which we had in Denver in
May, 1923, when he admitted to me that he was frequently misquoted
and made to say things which he never even thought of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>By some prank of fate, Sir Arthur was booked to lecture in
Denver at the same time I was performing there.</p>

<p>Lady Doyle, Sir Arthur, Mrs. Houdini and myself went out
motoring in the morning and when we returned to the hotel Sir
Arthur excused himself. About two hours later on my way to the
Orpheum Theatre, Sir Arthur came dashing through the lobby
of the hotel excitedly looking around for someone. I walked up
to him saying, “Anything I can do for you?” He put his arm
around me and said, “Houdini, there is a challenge of $5,000
in this paper which I am purported to have issued. I want you
to know that I would never dream of doing such a thing, to you
above everyone else.”</p>

<p>I replied, “Sir Arthur, this is just another case, where you
have been misquoted. No doubt you are thinking that I am
going to believe it, for I know that if conditions were reversed
you would have believed it; therefore, you see it is best to investigate
before giving credence to anything as being a fact. I am
not even upset about it—things happen that way. Will you
please remember this incident the next time you read an interview
supposedly issued by me?” Sir Arthur left for Salt Lake City
the next morning.</p>

<p>I walked into the Editorial Department of the <i>Denver Express</i>,
saw Mr. Sydney B. Whipple, the Managing Editor, and told him
that I had met Sir Arthur the night before and that he was very
indignant at the challenge which the paper reported he issued.
I said, “You see, Mr. Whipple, Sir Arthur, Lady Doyle, Mrs.
Houdini and myself were out motoring all yesterday afternoon,
and when Sir Arthur returned he saw the “scare head-line” to the
effect that he had challenged me for $5,000! Whipple asked,
“You mean to say that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle denies having
challenged you?” I replied, “Most emphatically,—he said that
it was not true and he never made such a statement and added
he had written to the Editor to let him know what he thought of
him for misrepresenting and misquoting what he said.” Mr.
Whipple asked me to wait a moment until he got to the bottom
of the matter.</p>

<p>Whipple called over Mr. Sam Jackson and said, “Regarding
this challenge of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, did he or did he not
challenge Houdini during your interview?” Jackson answered,
“Why he positively did. You do not think, Mr. Whipple, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
would come in with a story which is not true? Sir Arthur distinctly
made his statement in terms positive, that he was willing
to challenge Houdini for $5,000. Miss Jeanette Thornton was
there at the time interviewing Lady Doyle, and she overheard the
conversation. Will you please call her and have her confirm my
statement.”</p>

<p>Miss Thornton came over and upon being questioned, answered,
“Most assuredly I heard Sir Arthur’s challenge yesterday. I
thought it was a very interesting incident so I paid particular
attention. I am surprised that Sir Arthur now denies having
made it.”</p>

<p>Whipple turned to me saying, “There you are—any further
proof you want, is there anything we can do for you to contradict
this? Do you wish us to make a statement?” To which I replied,
“No, just let it go, we will let it pass.”</p>

<span class="subheada"><i>Exposure of Mrs. Stewart</i></span></h3>

<p>It is significant to note that on December 28, 1923, at St
Louis, Mo., I was fortunate in forming acquaintance with Judge
Daniel G. Taylor, who presided over Division No. 2 of the
Circuit Court, to which division Josie K. Folsom-Stewart, as
President, Charles W. Stewart, Secretary, and Phoebe S. Wolf,
as Treasurer, made application for incorporation of the “Society
of Scientific and Religious Truthseekers,” who claimed that they
had associated themselves by articles of agreement in writing, as
a “Society for religious and mutual improvement purposes.”
“The articles of agreement and association are signed by some
forty persons.” As was customary in such cases, Judge Taylor
“appointed J. Lionberger Davis, then a practicing attorney, now
President of Security National Bank, as amicus curiae to examine
into the matter and report whether or not the charter should be
granted.” The outcome of which was evidence of guilt of fraudulent
manifestations of mediumship. In the course of investigation,
Miss Martha Grossman, a member of Mrs. Folsom’s
“Development Class,” testified that Mr. Stewart and Mrs. Folsom
were conducting meetings which she had attended for six months,
at which time she saw writing on cards which Mrs. Folsom said
was done by Spirits.</p>

<p>Miss Grossman testified that what Mrs. Folsom claimed to be
spirit photographs were mere transfers from prints in the <i>Post-Dispatch</i>,
advertising “Syrup of Figs” and “Lydia Pinkham’s”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
concoction. It also developed that Miss Alice C. Preston confessed
to having been a confederate and in that capacity “assisted
Mrs. Folsom in producing, physically, and by natural means, the
supposed supernatural demonstrations.” A reference to this testimony
is contained in the memorandum document on the evidence
which is signed by the attorney for the petitioners and which is
in the court files.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, Judge Taylor denied the petition for incorporation,
which in any event could have been granted for the purpose
of holding real estate only, and not for promulgating teachings
of a cult.</p>

<p>The Judge acknowledged that he himself was convinced that
Mrs. Folsom was a fraud; and this is the same <em>Mrs. Stewart</em>,
who appeared before the Scientific American Committee of Investigation
in 1923, wherein she was detected in her card-trick.</p>

<p>Mrs. Folsom was forced to acknowledge to the court in 1905
that she was the author of a small book under title of “Non-Godism,”
a copy of which together with documentary evidence
bearing on the court proceedings referred to above are now in
my possession.</p>

in search of the northwest passage. The expedition sailed from Greenhithe,
May 18, 1845, and was last spoken off the entrance of Lancaster Sound, July
26, 1845. Thirty-nine relief expeditions, public and private, were sent out from
England and America in search of the missing explorer between 1847 and 1857.
McClintock found traces of the missing expedition in 1859, which confirmed
previous rumors of its total destruction.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his book, “Our American Adventures,” states:</p>

<p>“The original house was removed by pious hands and reconstructed, as I
understand it, at Lily Dale. It is not generally known that when it was pulled
down or it may have been before, the bones of the murdered peddler and his
tin box were discovered buried in the cellar, as was stated in the original rappings.
The rappings were in 1848, the discovery in 1903. What have our
opponents to say to this?”</p>

<p>According to Margaret Fox’s confession, Doyle’s statements are misleading
and contrary to the facts.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> There were three investigations by competent investigators. One in Buffalo
by medical doctors, one in Philadelphia by the Seybert Commission of the
University of Pennsylvania, and one in Boston by a committee of professors
from Harvard University. Any one of the three would have resulted disastrously
for the medium had the conditions and requirements demanded by
the investigators been complied with. A suspicion was well founded in the
minds of the investigators as to the actual solution of the problem, but they
were not permitted to proceed to a finish, the mediums hedging each time when a
crucial test was proposed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> I have been warned while writing this book to be careful regarding my
statement of the confession of Margaret Fox. I am also fully aware of the
fact that Dr. Funk writes in his book, “The Widow’s Mite”:</p>

<p>“Margaret Fox, not long before her death, confessed that she and her sister
had duped the public. This unfortunate woman had sunk so low that for five
dollars she would have denied her own mother and sworn to anything. At that
time her affidavit for or against anything should not be given the slightest
weight.”</p>

<p>Mr. W. S. Davis, himself a practicing medium, who knew Margaret Fox
Kane personally, wrote me:</p>

<p>“One would think that Margaret Fox got drunk, and in that condition, was
induced to confess that she was a fraud, but when she became sober she renounced
her confession. That is what we would think to hear some Spiritualists
talk. <em>She was sober when the made her confession; she was sober when she
appeared in the theatre and gave her exposé. In fact she was usually sober.</em>
She drank considerably during the later years of her life, and often drank too
much, <em>but usually she was sober</em>. One of her reasons for drinking was that her
hypocrisy had become more and more distasteful to her. Living a constant lie
got on her nerves, and, when the later years came, she didn’t have the same
degree of vital force that she had in her younger days to battle off the dictates
of her conscience.”</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Ira, the surviving brother, was so touched by this little act that he taught
me the famous Davenport rope-tie, the secret of which had been so well kept
that not even his sons knew it.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> It was in Paris too that the other brother, William Henry Harrison Davenport,
met the great Adah Isaacs Menken, called the “Bengal Tiger,” and though
not generally known she later became his wife. She was considered one of the
“Ten Super-Women of the World.” She was born within a few miles of New
Orleans, La., in 1835. Upon the death of her father she embarked on her stage
career and instantaneously won success.... She made her first appearance in
New York City at the National Theatre in 1860. She was married a number of
times. Her first marriage was to John C. Heenan, the prize fighter, better
known as “Benicia Boy.” She was the first woman to do the Mazeppa in tights,
playing the rôle both in America and Europe. While in London she became the
literary and professional star of the hour and her hotel was the meeting place
for such men as Charles Dickens, Swinburne, Alexander Dumas, Charles Reade,
Watts Phillips, John Oxenford, The Duke of Hamilton and many others. She
wrote a book of poems named “Infelicity,” which she dedicated to Charles
Dickens. She had a penchant for being photographed with many of her admirers
and there is a rare photograph of her and Swinburne which he tried
hard to suppress. Another famous one is of Dumas and the fair lady.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> They were married in London during March, 1866.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Long after Ira died his only daughter, Zellie, a well known actress, told
me that while her father and I were so absorbed in discussing and experimenting
with the rope trick she and her mother cautiously slipped behind the curtains
and watched us through the bedroom window.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Ira told me that at first they used to work unbound in a corner of the
room with a curtain to conceal their methods. At one of their seances they
were asked if the Spirits would work if the Brothers allowed themselves to be
tied. This led them to try out different rope methods, gradually developing the
one used all over the world which Ira taught me, saying smilingly after he had
done so: “Houdini, we started it, you finish it.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> I had the honor of being instrumental in launching and directing Dean
Kellar’s farewell at the Hippodrome in New York City and he selected me to
be his last assistant. As a part of the performance he presented with some
table tipping what he called the “Davenport Cabinet and Rope Mystery.” After
the performance he walked to the footlights and said:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I am finished giving performances to-night. As I
will have no further use for the cabinet and table I publicly present them to
my dear friend Houdini.”</p>

<p>In this cabinet, made in imitation of the one used by the Davenport Brothers,
the benches are fitted into a groove making it possible for them to be slipped
out in case of an extra severe tie-up, giving enough freedom to ring bells and
do a number of other things without releasing the hands in the usual way. This
is something of an improvement in mystery cabinets.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> They rubbed vaseline into their hands and wrists to facilitate their movements.
The rope generally used was similar to the Silver Lake sash cord.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It was sometimes claimed that after their demonstrations were over the
Davenports turned the papers and remarked them. This Ira said was a deliberate
lie as they never left their places throughout the entire performance.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> At one of their seances a man tied the brothers so tightly that it was necessary
for them to make a desperate struggle to effect a release. The next night
the man tried a more difficult test, simply laying the ropes all over their bodies,
but the Davenports worked so slowly, deftly, and with such inexhaustible patience
that they saved their reputation.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Nor did he hesitate to tell me that he sometimes used as many as ten confederates

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> William Fay, in order to be prepared for an emergency, always carried a
piece of rope in his mandolin, and boasted to his partners:</p>

<p>“I’ll not chaw the ropes like you fellows, I’ll cut.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The original cabinet of the Davenports, made of bird’s-eye maple, was

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> In order to prove to the public that they did not make use of their hands
test conditions were imposed by filling both the brothers’ hands with flour and
then tying them behind their backs. Almost every publication that has written
an exposé of the Davenport Brothers claims with glee that the trick was performed
by putting flour into their pockets from which they took a fresh
handful after the manifestations were finished and pretending that their hands
were clenched all the time. It is claimed that once a committeeman instead of
placing flour in their hands filled them with snuff and after the manifestations
had been performed they had their hands fulls of flour. Ira told me that this
was a deliberate lie as they did not need to get rid of the flour in their hands
as they could do all the tricks with their hands clenched using the free thumb.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The levitation act which has helped to swell the ranks of the Spiritualists
and which mystified scientist and laymen alike, was one of the simplest deceptions
ever practiced on the guileless masses by cunning mediums. A reformed
medium in Bristol, England, told me that he would endeavor to free himself
from his restraints, and by deft manipulations managed to pick up a person
who sat in a chair nearby. Although the sitter had only been lifted a few
inches from the floor he believed in all good faith that his head had actually
brushed the ceiling, this impression being created by the medium gently passing
his hand over the top of the sitter’s head.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> As to the delusion of sound. Sound waves are deflected just as light waves
are reflected by the intervention of a proper medium and under certain conditions
it is a difficult thing to locate their source. Stuart Cumberland told me an
interesting test to prove the inability of a blindfolded person to trace sound to
its source. It is exceedingly simple; merely clicking two coins over the head of
the blindfolded person.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> This refers to our contemplated tour of the world. When I first became

the entertainment field and we set about planning a tour of the world

would have been able to set the world agog. Under no circumstances, however,
would we have claimed our performance Spiritualistic, but just a mystery
entertainment.</p>

protested the way the boys had been secured and without waiting for instructions
or a word from the Brothers, whipped out a knife and cut the ropes. Ira
told me that it was too bad that Ferguson did that for they never could have
secured them so they could not have produced some manifestations.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Ira told me that he believed that their success so diminished the popularity

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was appearing in Australia in 1920 he
met Bendigo Rymer, the grandson of J. S. Rymer, who had entertained Home
lavishly. Bendigo showed Sir Arthur a number of letters from his grandfather
which proved conclusively that Home had been guilty of taking advantage of
the man’s friendship. Rymer had entertained Home in England and sent him
to Rome with his son to study art. From Rome young Rymer wrote his
father that as soon as Home had been able to elbow his way into society he
totally ignored him though as host he was paying Home’s expenses. Finally
Home ran away and lived with a titled English woman, shunning Rymer
altogether.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur in his book, “The Wanderings of a Spiritualist,” says in reference
to Home: “For weeks he lived at her villa, although the state of his health
would suggest that it was rather as a patient than a lover.” In his introduction
to Madame Home’s book Sir Arthur entirely forgives this rude action of Home
and strongly defends his base ingratitude.</p>

sweeping a crossing or something as respectable.—<cite>London Fun</cite>, 1864.</p>

saying:</p>

<p>“Very especially the second series is commended to the student of Home,
because in it will be found all the papers dealing with the Home-Lyon
lawsuit showing conclusively how honorable was the action of Home.”</p>

<p>Does he wish us to infer that it was Home who brought the suit against
Mrs. Lyon, rather than the opposite?</p>

ease was: first actually get out of the window, or pretend to; then, go back and
noiselessly crawl on all fours through the door into the next room and shake the
window; and lastly, boldly return to the first room, closing the door with a bang.</p>

<p>There is a possibility that a man of Home’s audacity with levitation feats
might have resorted to swinging from one window to another, which means
nothing to any acrobat with a wire properly placed in readiness.</p>

<p>The idea of Home losing his physical weight and floating out of the window
head first is merely a suggestion of his, a ruse which is still being used by

evidence that the two hands of the medium are being kept busy, is for the
medium to keep up a continuous clapping of the hands, working the hands near
the face or some other exposed part of the body and simply change the clapping
of one hand against another to the clapping of one hand against the body. In the
dark the effect is the same and the sitter believes that both the medium’s hands
are busily engaged in clapping.</p>

and mystifying means of table levitation. The medium and her subjects place
the tips of their fingers on the top of the table lightly. The medium gently
rocks the table back and forth until she gets it in a correct position to place her
foot, or the hem of her dress, under one of the legs. When she perfects her
position she presses down with the hand above the table leg that is resting on
her foot. From then on it is only a matter of raising the foot to whatever
height she wishes the table to rise. If she wants it levitated to a great height,
she gives it an upward kick and then withdraws her foot, and the table rises
and falls true to the laws of gravitation.</p>

three methods by which she was able to employ substitution in regard to
hands at the table, four in regard to foot substitution, half a dozen methods of
table levitation, several ways of producing knocks, two ways in which she produced
the illusion of a current of air coming from her forehead. She told him
that she was not annoyed when caught practicing tricks, nor did she deny their
use when caught. She said to him, <em>“All mediums indulge in tricks—all.”</em> She
also told him that she was a good Catholic, went to Mass, made her confession,
and said she hated to hear people talk about “super-normal,” or “supernatural”
phenomena.</p>

various other things calculated to confuse and muddle men, all of which was

buxom woman and it is not strange that a lot of old scientists were badly
flabbergasted by such conduct.</p>

was told that the famous medium was present. A voice from the cabinet,
supposedly Palladino’s, said, “I, who used to call back the Spirits, now come
back as a Spirit myself,” to which Sir Arthur answered, “Palladino, we send
you our love and our best encouragement.” However, the force was broken by
“the absurd and vile dancing of the table,” and there was no physical manifestation.

Committees and they were believed. There never was a unanimous report
or conclusion. The non-Spiritual (?) members of the Dialectical Society refused

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle seems to imagine that all the newspapers in the
world are against him. After his Australian tour he accused the Australian
papers of refusing to publish the truth about his seances. Writing about
American newspapers in his book, “An American Adventure,” he says: “The
editors seem to place the intelligence of the public very low, and to imagine that
they cannot be attracted save by vulgar, screaming headlines.</p>

<p>“The American papers have a strange way also of endeavoring to compress
the whole meaning of some item into a few words of headline, which, as often
as not, are slang.”</p>

<p>Even in Canada Sir Arthur claims to have badly used by the newspapers.
In “Our American Adventure” he writes: “There were some rather bitter attacks
in the Toronto papers, including the one leader in the <i>Evening Telegram</i>,
which was so narrow and illiberal that I do not think the most provincial
paper in Britain could have been guilty of it.</p>

<p>“It was to the effect that British lecturers took money out of the town, that
they did not give the money’s worth, and that they should be discouraged.</p>

<p>“‘Poking Them in the Eye’ was the dignified title.</p>

<p>“It did not seem to occur to the writer that a comic opera or a bedroom
comedy was equally taking the money out of the town, but that the main purpose
served by lectures, whether one agreed with the subject or not, was that
they kept the public in first hand touch with the great current questions of mankind.
I am bound to say that no other Toronto paper sank to the depth of the
<i>Evening Telegram</i> but the general atmosphere was the least pleasant that I
had met with in my American travels.”</p>

P. J. Cormican, S. J., he asks:</p>

<p>“Does the knighted prophet of the New Revelation (Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle) tell the whole truth about Spiritism? We think not. He says nothing
about the evil consequences, physical, intellectual and moral, to those who dabble
in Spiritism. He gives a one-sided account of the matter. He says nothing
about what Spiritism has done, and is still doing, to fill our lunatic asylums
all over the world. There are over thirty thousand lunatics in England alone
who lost their mind through this modern necromancy. Doyle does not even
hint at the countless cases of insanity and suicide, of blasphemy and obscenity,
of lying and deception, of broken homes and violated troth, all caused by
Spiritism. To suppose that a God of truth and sanctity is giving a new
message through such sources and with such consequences, is blasphemy pure and
simple. Furthermore, to assert that this New Revelation is to supersede a
worn-out creed is both gratuitous and absurd. Christianity will last till the
crack of doom, when titled prophets shall have ceased to cross the Atlantic in
quest of American shekels.”</p>

in New York, I used one hundred and ten feet of thread and two hundred
needles; at the Berlin Winter Garden one hundred feet of thread and one hundred
needles. In the regular large size theatres I use about eighty feet of
thread and a hundred needles but for ordinary purposes thirty-five feet of
thread and seventy-five needles are sufficient.</p>

<p>So far this trick has never been properly explained but that does not prove
that I have abnormal powers. This needle mystery has been examined by a
great many physicians and surgeons and in Boston at Keith’s Theatre it was
presented at a special performance to over a thousand physicians and they
were unable to explain it. However, there is nothing abnormal in it. It is
nothing more than a clever and natural mystification.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
